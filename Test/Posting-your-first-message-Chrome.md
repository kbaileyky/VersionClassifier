# Posting Your First Privly Message - Google Chrome

## Introduction

This is a guide for posting your first message in Google Chrome.

## Getting the Extension

If you do not already have the extension, go to the [Privly downloads page](https://priv.ly/pages/download.html).
Otherwise skip down to [Logging in](#logging-in)



Click on the "Download Privly" button, which will direct you to the add-on/extension download page for your browser.
Please note: right now the Privly extension is only available in alpha for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

Once at the extension/add on store, click on the "Add to Chrome" button if you are using Chrome.

For Chrome, a pop-up will appear to confirm installation - click the "Add" button.

The Privly extension should now be visible on your browser. 
The icon has a small box labeled "ON" to indicate that it will replace Privly links with the message associated with those links.

Congratulations! You have finished installing the extension!


## Logging in

After installing the extension, the next step is to login or create your account.

First, click on the Privly extension icon near the address bar.

A drop down menu will appear, click on "New Message".
(Note: clicking on "View History", "New Message", "Options", and "Help" will all lead you to a link to the login page. Because our goal is to post a message, we chose "New Message" in this case)

On the Message page, click on the login button on either the highlighted message or on the toolbar.

If you have an account skip down to [[Have account|]]

If you do not have an account, put your email in the text box under register and click on the "Request invite on https://dev.privly.org" button.

(This Section is still under construction, Sorry! )
TODO fill in how to register



Type your email and password into the appropriate boxes and press the "Login to https://dev.privly.org".
If the login was successful, skip to [[Creating the Message]].

If you were unable to login, first make sure that you email and password were typed correctly. 
Please be aware that too many failed attempts will block you from logging on for a little while, even if you email and password are correct.

If after you are sure that your email and password are correct you are still unable to login, you may be attempting to connect to the wrong server.
To fix this click on the "Options" menu on the Privly toolbar.


Then click on "Extension Options".

Scroll to the bottom of the page where the section "Content Servers" is located.
From the drop-down box, select the server that your invitation is associated with and click the save button.

Return to the login page and try again.
(Note: if at any time you remove the Privly extension and re-install it, you will have to resave your content server)
