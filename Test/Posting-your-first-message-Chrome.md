# Posting Your First Privly Message - Google Chrome

## Introduction

This is a guide for posting your first message in Google Chrome.

## Getting the Extension

If you do not already have the extension, go to the [Privly downloads page](https://priv.ly/pages/download.html).
Otherwise skip down to [Registration](#registration) or [Logging in.](#logging-in)



Click on the "Download Privly" button, which will direct you to the add-on/extension download page for your browser.
Please note: right now the Privly extension is only available in alpha for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

![Click the "Download Privly" button to download the extension.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/whereToDownload.JPG "Click the "Download Privly" button to download the extension.")

Once at the extension/add on store, click on the "Add to Chrome" button if you are using Chrome.

![Click the "Add to Chrome" to get the Privly extension to Chrome.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/getPlugin1.JPG "Click the "Add to Chrome" to get the Privly extension to Chrome.")

For Chrome, a pop-up will appear to confirm installation - click the "Add" button.

![Click the "Add" button to confirm your addition.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/getPlugin2.JPG "Click the "Add" button to confirm your addition.")

The Privly extension should now be visible on your browser. 
The icon has a small box labeled "ON" to indicate that it will replace Privly links with the message associated with those links.

Congratulations! You have finished installing the Privly extension!


## Registering

After installing the extension, the next step is to login or create your account.

First, click on the Privly extension icon near the address bar.

![Click the "New Message" button from the drop down menu.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/newMessage1.JPG "Click the "New Message" button from the drop down menu.")

A drop down menu will appear, click on "New Message".
(Note: clicking on "View History", "New Message", "Options", and "Help" will all lead you to a link to the login page. Because our goal is to post a message, we chose "New Message" in this case)

On the Message page, click on the login button on either the highlighted message or on the toolbar.

![Clicking either login button will lead you to the login page.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/login1.JPG "Clicking either login button will lead you to the login page.")

If you have an account skip down to [Logging in](#creating-the-message)

If you do not have an account, put your email in the text box under register and click on the "Request invite on https://dev.privly.org" button.

### Register for PrivlyAlpha
    
    Go to the [Privly Alpha website](https://privlyalpha.org) and type your email in the "Want an Invite?" text box and click the "Get Invited" button. 

    You will then recieve an email with further instructions.

### Register for dev.Privly (for developers)

Go to the [Dev.Privly website](https://dev.privly.org) and type your email in the "Want an Invite?" text box and click the "Get Invited" button. 

You will then recieve an email with further instructions.

## Logging in

Type your email and password into the appropriate boxes and press the "Login to https://dev.privly.org".
If the login was successful, skip to [Creating the Message](#creating-the-message).

![After filling out your login information, press the login button.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/login2.JPG "Clicking either login button will lead you to the login page."After filling out your login information, press the login button.")


If you were unable to login, first make sure that you email and password were typed correctly. 
Please be aware that too many failed attempts will block you from logging on for a little while, even if you email and password are correct.

If after you are sure that your email and password are correct you are still unable to login, you may be attempting to connect to the wrong server.
To fix this click on the "Options" menu on the Privly toolbar.


Then click on "Extension Options".

![Click here to change your content server.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/options1.JPG "Click here to change your content server.")



Scroll to the bottom of the page where the section "Content Servers" is located.
From the drop-down box, select the server that your invitation is associated with and click the save button.

![After selecting the correct content server, click the save button.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/contentserver1.JPG "After selecting the correct content server, click the save button.")

Return to the login page and try again.
(Note: if at any time you remove the Privly extension and re-install it, you will have to resave your content server.)


## Creating the Message


** Disclaimer: Privly is still in the alpha phase of development and may still not be completely secure. Do not store sensitive data yet. See the [Safety page](https://priv.ly/pages/safety.html) for more information. **

If you originally clicked on "New Message" after logging in you should be taken to the New Message page.
If you did not click on the "New Message" option, click it on the navigation bar at the top of the page.

Type your message in the text box and select how long you would like the data to remain on the server, then click the save button.

![Save your message on the content server.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/NewMessage2.JPG "Save your message on the content server.")

This causes the two yellow boxes to appear on the top of the screen.
The link in the second box is what you will give to people so that they can see the message you wrote.



![Copy and paste your generated link.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/NewMessage3.JPG "Copy and paste your generated link.")


Click the link to highlight it and copy and paste to where you want to post your message.

![Paste the link to share your Privly message.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/PasteMessage.JPG "Paste the link to share your Privly message.")




Congratulations! you have just created your first Privly message!


## Receiving a Message

This section explains what a Privly message will look like to the receiver(s).

### With Privly Extension

If you have the Privly extension and it is currently "ON" (actively substituting Privly links), the message will appear as a text message for the receiver.

![The Privly message is easily read by the receiver.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/RecieveMessage1.JPG "The Privly message is easily read by the reciever.")


### Without Privly Extension

If the receiver of a Privly message does not have the extension or the extenstion is currently "OFF", the message will appear as a link.

![The Privly message is a link the reciever can click on.](https://github.com/kbaileyky/VersionClassifier/blob/master/Test/graphics/RecieveMessage2.JPG "The Privly message is a link the receiver can click on.")

The receiver can click on the link to view the message.

TThe Priv.ly Project is still under active development. Think of using privacy software under “active development” like crossing a bridge that is still under construction.
