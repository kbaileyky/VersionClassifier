Click on the "Download Privly" button, which will direct you to the add-on/extension download page for your browser.
Please note: right now the Privly extension is only available in alpha for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

For Chrome, a pop-up will appear to confirm installation - click the "Add" button.

The Privly extension should now be visible on your browser. 
The icon has a small box labeled "ON" to indicate that it will replace Privly links with the message associated with those links.

Congratulations! You have finished installing the extension!


## Logging in

After installing the extension, the next step is to login or create your account.

First, click on the Privly extension icon near the address bar.

A drop down menu will appear, click on "New Message".
(Note: clicking on "View History", "New Message", "Options", and "Help" will all lead you to a link to the login page. Because our goal is to post a message, we chose "New Message" in this case)

On the Message page, click on the login button on either the highlighted message or on the toolbar.

If you have an account skip down to [[Have account|]]

If you do not have an account, put your email in the text box under register and click on the "Request invite on https://dev.privly.org" button.

TODO fill in how to register


Type your email and password into the appropriate boxes and press the "Login to https://dev.privly.org".
If the login was successful, skip to [[Creating a message|]]

If you were unable to login, first make sure that you email and password were typed correctly. 
Please be aware that too many failed attempts will block you from logging on for a little while, even if you email and password are correct.

If after you are sure that your email and password are correct you are still unable to login, you may be attempting to connect to the wrong server.
To fix this click on the "Options" menu on the Privly toolbar.

Then click on "Extension Options".
