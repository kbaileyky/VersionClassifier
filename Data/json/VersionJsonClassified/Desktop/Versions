{"VersionNumber":"1.1","ReleaseDate":"05/10/2010","ReleaseContents":"Please note: This release no longer works on Mac OS X 10.4 or PowerPC-based Macs.\nGENERAL IMPROVEMENTS\n\t\tUpgraded the Subversion 1.6 library to SVN 1.6.15\n\t\tAdded support for HTTP(S) proxy settings\n\t\tAdded Growl support for completed operations\n\t\tImproved Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) support\n\t\tFixed an issue that could display a “(SASL(-1): All-whitespace username” error message, and provide a more accurate error message\n\t\tFixed an issue that caused copious console log messages saying “No worthy mechs found”\n\t\tVersions now automatically verifies HTTPS certificates against the Keychain when possible\n\t\tThis fixes repeated warnings about certificates in many cases (e.g. with Google Code)\n\t\tAccepting a certificate by using the “Accept for this session only” option will now actually accept the certificate for the whole app session\n\t\tOn launch, Versions now opens up to the last selected bookmark\n\t\tVersions has a refreshed look and feel\nREDESIGNED AND IMPROVED TIMELINE\n\t\tHyperlinks (http://, rdar:// and others) are now detected and linked\n\t\tAdded issue tracker ticket detection for FogBugz (BugzID:123) and JIRA (#PRJ-123)\n\t\tMore compact and clear layout, with spelled out file status labels\n\t\tNow uses floating headers for each day\n\t\t“Load more…” now respects the scroll position and collapsed days\n\t\tIt's now possible to show or hide the changed files and folders for an individual revision\n\t\tOption + click to show/hide all visible files, or open/close all days\n\t\tSimplified preferences to only set a number of revisions to load, instead of a number of days as well\n\t\tAdded an indicator showing when the timeline was last refreshed\n\t\tDates and times are now shown using localized formatting\n\t\tFixed a bug where the timeline progress spinner would sometimes remain visible when switching views\n\t\tThe Timeline now has a special ‘empty’ state when a repository doesn't have any history yet\nIMPROVED BROWSE VIEW DRAG & DROP SUPPORT\n\t\tDragging an item out of repository or working copy browser will export it\n\t\tDragging an item into a repository browser will offer to import that item\n\t\tMoving multiple items in a working copy will now ask for confirmation\n\t\tThe “Move Item” and “Copy Item” dialogs are now more informative\nIMPROVED BOOKMARKS LIST\n\t\tBetter drag & drop support\n\t\tBookmarks can be created by dropping working copy or local repository folders on the Dock icon or bookmarks list\n\t\tBookmarks can be created by dropping URL files on the bookmarks list\n\t\tBookmarks can only be dropped within other bookmarks if they point to a directory within the parent bookmark.\n\t\tBookmarks can be dropped between top level items, instead of only being dropped into top level items\n\t\tItems dropped on the bookmarks list that can't be turned into bookmarks are listed in an ignored items sheet\n\t\tWhen a bookmark is dragged onto another closed bookmark group or repository, the destination is now expanded and the bookmark selected\n\t\tWhen deleting a bookmark, Versions no longer offers to delete the corresponding working copy folder if:\n\t\tIt didn't exist in the first place\n\t\tThere's another working copy bookmark that's the parent of this one\n\t\tBookmark names consist by default of the repository name and the folder, to prevent them from being nameless or from being named just trunk, branches, or tags\n\t\tBookmarks are, when possible, added to the current selected group, an appropriate ancestor or sibling instead of always to the bottom of the list\n\t\tThe context menu for repository bookmarks now has a “Copy Remote URL” menu item\n\t\tThe context menu for working copy bookmarks now has a “Copy Remote URL”, “Copy Local Path” and a “Reveal in Finder” menu item\n\t\tThere now is a context menu for the empty area of the bookmark list which displays the \"New\" menu\n\t\tA bookmark can now be deleted by using the backspace key\n\t\tWhen a bookmark has focus Command + C now always copies the remote path to the clip board\n\t\tAdded keyboard shortcuts for “New Repository Bookmark” Command + Option + N, and “New Working Copy Bookmark” Command + Option + Shift + N\n\t\tLocal Repositories bookmarks now have their own icon to make them more distinguishable\nOTHER IMPROVEMENTS\n\t\tKaleidoscope is now always visible in the file comparison popup in preferences\n\t\tFixed a crash that would occur when trying to duplicate a repositories root item\n\t\tFixed the Inspector not properly updating when switching between All/Changed\n\t\tFixed the Inspector Raw Properties button properly disabling when unversioned items are selected\n\t\tThe About window and SVN error sheets now close when using the ESC key\n\t\tFixed the split view cursor to properly update when moving from timeline and bookmarks list\n\t\tFixed several registration interaction issues\n\t\tFixed the main window not being closable, and menus being disabled, after trying to commit a folder without changes\n\t\tAdded support for multi-machine license files for volume licenses\n\t\tUpgraded the trial period to 30 days instead of 21\n\t\tThis update resets the trial period\n\t\tUpdated the built-in Help\n\t\tReduced file size of the application\nSofa has acquired all Versions intellectual property from Pico.
