- Get faster performance and less buffering, even when you have so-so internet connection. We_ve also fixed the most common crashes and bugs. 
- When you_re in a rush, a long press on any Concierge situation (e.g. Driving) immediately starts playing the playlist Songza thinks you'll love most at that moment. Starting your Songza playlist can now be as fast as turning on your car radio. 
- Songza_s HQ Audio feature, powered by Audyssey, significantly improves your headphone sound quality without increasing your data plan usage. With Songza 3.0_s improved HQ Audio, 200 headphone models are now available and it_s now easier to select your headphones whenever you add a new pair.

Audyssey_s HQ Audio optimizes your music at every volume for deep, detailed, pitch-perfect sound. Pick your headphones, play your favorite Songza playlist, and hear the difference.
The Audyssey HQ Audio feature on Songza works by applying this headphone-specific profile to the song file in real-time. Adjustments are made to the music at each frequency so that the signal that the media player sends to the headphone has taken into account its particular fit and specs. The result is studio reference sound that has the quality of a much bigger music file.
