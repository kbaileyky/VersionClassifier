OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

Sofa has acquired all Versions intellectual property from Pico. You can read the entire press release here.
This is a bugfix release that fixes issues that cropped up in the previous Versions 1.0.8 release.
We would like to thank everybody who enabled us to make a significant donation to Doctors Without Borders by buying Versions between January 14 and February 15th. We would also like to introduce and welcome Pieter de Bie as a new member to the Versions development team.
		Made several key improvements to file comparison stability and functionality:
		The “Compare Diff” toolbar item has been renamed to “Compare”
A big thank you to everyone who tested pre-release builds, and everybody else for their patience.
		This issue was specific to svn+ssh:// connections
		If you switched off the “Show badges with working copy changes” preference to get less of these crash reports, you can safely switch that back on
		This means that after this update, the next update will no longer request access to passwords in your Keychain that were last used with earlier releases of Versions
		This issue was caused by child processes that got stuck making svn+ssh:// connections on some machines
We'd like to thank everybody who tested, and gave us feedback on, our tiny Snow Leopard beta.
		This allows edits made in FileMerge to be saved more easily
		Updated the Help documentation with an FAQ page
		Corrected a linguistic error in the EULA, seize -> cease
		This also switches off the orange badges on folders with changed contents in the Browse view
		Small update to the Help documentation
		Changed section B1 in the license agreement to be more clear about registering Versions on multiple computers
To everyone who tried the beta, and especially those of you who provided feedback: Thank you!  We are very grateful for your support and Versions wouldn't be what is today without your help.

Hey! Our eighth update, featuring the new Stranger's Dream free DLC, should be deploying today. This update will be applied automatically when players run their Steam client. The change list includes:

- Fixed some English-language subtitles.
We hope you enjoy the new content! Thanks everyone for your continued support of this game.
Hey, our seventh update should be deploying today. It addresses several issues and adds support for other alphabets, enabling translations in other languages. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes:
- Added custom language support for alphabets based on Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, to support requests for player-created translations to other languages. To add a custom language to the game, follow these steps:
1. Determine the two-letter language code according to ISO 639-1
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
e.g. Portuguese = pt, Russian = ru, Polish = pl
The following example is for creating a Russian (ru) translation.
2. Navigate to Steam\steamapps\common\bastion\Content\Game\Text, and make a copy of HelpText.en.xml called HelpText.ru.xml.
3. Translate the text in HelpText.ru.xml from English to Russian. At the top of the file, make sure the line reads: <HelpText lang="ru">
4. Create a folder in Steam\steamapps\common\bastion\Content\Subtitles\r u
5. Copy over the files in Steam\steamapps\common\bastion\Content\Subtitles\e n, and translate them.
6. Launch the game with '-lang ru' Launch Options
(for Launch option instructions: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_...1040-JWMT-2947)
Thanks to those of you expressing interest in taking the time to create fan translations and for playing.
Hey, our sixth update should be deploying today. It addresses additional crash issues and also adds seven new Steam Achievements. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes:
- Added seven new Steam Achievements! They are:
Use the Forge to fully upgrade every weapon.
Complete the Kid's Dream with five or more Shrine Idols invoked.
Complete the Kid's Dream with all ten Shrine Idols invoked.
Complete the Singer's Dream with five or more Shrine Idols invoked.
Complete the Singer's Dream with all ten Shrine Idols invoked.
Complete the Survivor's Dream with five or more Shrine Idols invoked.
Complete the Survivor's Dream with all ten Shrine Idols invoked.
Note: These achievements will not be awarded retroactively to players who met the requirements before this update. Man-at-Arms will be awarded when entering a fully upgraded Forge. 
Thanks again to everyone who's taken the time to send crash logs, and to all of you for playing.
Hey, our fifth update should be deploying today. This update is focused on improving game stability and will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes:
- Fix to typographical error in the Memorial Vigil, "The Skippers".
Thank you to everyone who's taken the time to send crash logs. 
We plan to continue updating the game in the coming days. Thank you for playing.
Our third update for Bastion should be out now, addressing several issues reported by players as well as adding some advanced settings. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes: 
- Added support for several advanced command-line parameters (aka Launch Options in Steam).
To set Launch Options in Steam, right-click on Bastion inyour game library, select Properties, then select Set Launch Options.
NOTE: Please be advised that these settings are recommended for advanced users and may adversely affect your game experience.
The parameters are:
Using the default Slinger-style WASD controls, diagonal movements will more closely adhere to the isometric perspective. We would appreciate your feedback about this change. 
Forces the game to start in windowed mode.
Forces the game to a specific X resolution.
Forces the game to a specific Y resolution.
Example: to run the game in 1280x720 (720p) resolution:"-windowed -x 1280 -y 720"
Runs the game in windowed mode but with no windows titlebar or border. (This may improve compatibility or performance versus full-screen mode in some cases or provide a preferable experience.)
Allows a custom joystick dead zone for players experiencingissues with their gamepads. Value is the fraction at which input should register. Example: "-deadzone 0.4".
Forces the game to load a specific text language. Available options are "en", "fr", "it","de", and "es" for English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish, respectively. Example: "-lang de"
Turns off fixed time step so that the game no longer dictates the frame rate. (This may improve performance for some users but may also lead to erratic performance in other cases.)
Thank you for playing Bastion.
Our second update should be going out now. Please exit out of the game to apply it. The fixes include:
We'll continue monitoring the feedback in this thread and via email. Thank you guys for your support.
Our first update should be going out now. Exit out of the game to apply it. The fixes include:

What's new in 2.9
Forming relationships on Raptr is now easier than ever. We know it was a bit confusing before as to whether you "friended" someone or "followed" them -- so we_re switching over to a follower system. With this update, the iOS app has been updated to reflect the changes on Raptr.com, which in the simplest terms means that there is no longer a "Friend Requests" menu.
You will still get push notifications with new followers, and as always can disable them in your Notifications Preferences.
Other changes in this update:
This release contains improvements to those users that connect their Steam account to the app:
NOTE: You might not be able to connect to Steam if you are in the Steam Trading Card Beta. We're addressing it now and the next update should restore Steam connectivity for those affected
Note: We're aware of an issue affecting some Xbox logins. An update is in the works to address this issue.
_ Full iPhone 5/iPod Touch 5G support coming soon, as we just got our hands on one of these magical unicorn devices.
What's new in v1.2:
== Finding Friends on Raptr == 
== Messaging ==
== Xbox ==
== Steam ==
== Other ==
NOTE: (6/18/2012) We're aware of the Xbox messaging not appearing in your Inbox...a new version has been submitted to Apple & we're just waiting for approval.
The dinos are working hard & we've got more updates in the queue coming soon!

Additional technical notes:
The Desktop application uses the "Chromium Embedded Framework" (CEF), which is a way to include the functionality of a web browser (based on Chrome) in the application - this enables us to develop features in modern programming languages and gives us the possibility to fix issues faster.
This update includes a major upgrade, from CEF1 to CEF3.
What is worth mentioning though is that this is a major "under the hood" change (techies may be interested in reading more on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework.)
Also, there's always a risk of unexpected issues with such "big" changes, but we are sure that it's the right thing for us to do - and hopefully our users will understand that they will get a much improved experience thanks to this.
