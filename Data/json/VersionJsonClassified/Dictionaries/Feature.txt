Audyssey developed a brand new technology to measure headphones and bring them closer to studio reference sound. Using this technology Audyssey creates a unique fine-tuned profile for each of the top-selling headphone brands and makes it available in the world_s largest headphone database.
You can turn Audyssey_s HQ Audio on from the Now Playing screen when you have headphones plugged in to your device. Simply slide the HQ switch down, select your headphones and you're done! The HQ switch will turn blue when active.
Music is mixed in acoustically calibrated studios by professionals listening at very high volumes. When you listen over headphones two things change: (1) every headphone has its own acoustical characteristics that are different from the studio and (2) most people listen to music at volumes well below studio levels, so their perception of high and low frequency balance is completely different from the original recording. 
Audyssey's audio engineers developed new technology to measure headphone characteristics and bring them closer to studio sound while adjusting the music balance so that it preserves the original content even when listening at lower volumes. 
The HQ Audio feature on Songza works by applying a headphone-specific filter to the song file in real-time that makes adjustments to the music at each frequency so that the signal that the media player sends to the headphone has taken into account its particular fit and specs. The result is sound that has the quality of a much bigger music file and can be heard the way the artist intended it to be heard. 
You can turn HQ Audio on from the Now Playing screen when you have headphones plugged in to your device. Simply slide the HQ switch down, select your headphones and you're done! The HQ switch will turn blue when active.

		New Feature: Kaleidoscope Snippets and Services
		You can now drag text and images directly into the Kaleidoscope window, or the Kaleidoscope dock icon, to create Snippets. This lets you quickly compare content without having to save and name files. Try dragging images or text directly from Safari or an email message!
		Open in Kaleidoscope: Right click on any files or folders in Finder, and compare them in a single Kaleidoscope tab. This is the easiest way to compare folders!

		You can use the new "Edit -> Paste as File" and "File -> New from Clipboard" menu items to compare directly from the Clipboard. This works similarly to the drag and drop Snippets functionality.
