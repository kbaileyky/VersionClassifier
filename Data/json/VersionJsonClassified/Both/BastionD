{"VersionNumber":"3","ReleaseDate":"18/08/2011","ReleaseContents":"Our third update for Bastion should be out now, addressing several issues reported by players as well as adding some advanced settings.

(This may improve compatibility or performance versus full-screen mode in some cases or provide a preferable experience.)\n-deadzone [value]\nAllows a custom joystick dead zone for players experiencingissues with their gamepads. Value is the fraction at which input should register. Example: \"-deadzone 0.4\".\n-lang [value]\nForces the game to load a specific text language. Available options are \"en\", \"fr\", \"it\",\"de\", and \"es\" for English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish, respectively. Example: \"-lang de\"\n-nofixedstep\nTurns off fixed time step so that the game no longer dictates the frame rate.
