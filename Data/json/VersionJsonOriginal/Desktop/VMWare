{"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"02/09/2014","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion Pro has been updated for OS X Yosemite. Visual changes include a new flatter application icon, changes to include translucent elements, and Yosemite style full-screen behavior.\nVMware Fusion Pro includes the latest virtual hardware revision with support for:\nAdvanced Haswell processor features, including AVX2 inside a virtual machine\nA new virtual webcam, making it easier than ever to use your webcam with Windows applications\nAn updated, virtual USB controller with support for XHCI 1.0\nA new approach to video memory that enables the VRAM limit to be specified per virtual machine\nThe amount of VRAM configured is not limited by the VRAM available to the host.\nThe ability to specify a preference for the integrated or discrete GPU\nOn recent Mac Book Pros that contain both GPUs, this can result in increased battery life for lightly used virtual machines.\nVMware Fusion Pro is more efficient than ever with wake-ups reduced by over 60% for lightly used virtual machines.\nOS X Yosemite can now be used inside a virtual machine.\nVMware Fusion Pro now shows the status of each virtual machine in the library list view. This is particularly useful for power users working with many virtual machines.\nImproved support for Retina displays, including changes to Unity mode and the ability to control how Fusion scales when moving between Retina-class and standard density displays.\nDirect sounds from virtual machines to a specific audio device on your Mac.\nPer-virtual machine shortcut keys make jumping quickly between operating systems a breeze.\nImproved support for Linux in virtual machines including CentOS 7 and RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.\nThe ability to access virtual machines running on VMware vSphere, VMware ESXi, and VMware Workstation directly from VMware Fusion Pro including:\nRemote display, keyboard, and mouse control\nAbility to select media for CD, DVD, floppy devices, including files on your Mac\nAbility to power virtual machines on and off and configure the network they connect to\nAbility to move virtual machines from your Mac to a remote location by dragging and dropping\nAbility to move virtual machines from a remote location to your Mac by dragging and dropping\nSee the state of your remote server with at-a-glance health summary based on Activity Monitor\nKnown Issues\nThe following issues might occur in VMware Fusion 7.0.\nOS X Yosemite is not yet final.\nLate breaking changes might affect compatibility with the final version of OS X Yosemite.\n3D acceleration is not provided for Mac OS X operating systems inside a virtual machine.\nThis prevents the use of some features that rely on 3D capabilities.\nWindows 8 always uses the discrete GPU even when GPU auto-switching is enabled.\nTo optimize for better battery life in Windows 8, select “Don’t Use High Performance Graphics (Longer Battery Life)” in the Display settings panel. (This option is only available on laptops with both an integrated and discrete GPU.)\nEntering Unity on Windows XP with “Use full resolution for Retina display” enabled might fail and revert to Single Window. \nWorkaround: Do not select “Use full resolution for Retina display.” Instead, downgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 10 in the Compatibility settings panel.\nWindows XP displays black side bars in full screen mode on monitors wider than 2560 pixels when “Use full resolution for Retina display” is enabled. \nWorkaround: To avoid this issue, either disable “Use full resolution for Retina display” or downgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 10 in the Compatibility settings panel.\nEntering Unity or Full Screen might fail.\nEntering Unity or Full Screen might fail and revert to Single Window when “Use full resolution for Retina display” is enabled when there is a low DPI monitor larger than 2048 pixels wide attached. Affected monitors include the Apple 27” and 30” Cinema Displays.\nWorkaround: To avoid this issue, disable “Use full resolution for Retina display.”\nOn some hardware, an OS X virtual machine upgraded to 10.9.3 fails to boot.\nWorkaround: Create a new OS X virtual machine with 10.9.3 and transfer your data.\nDrag and drop might fail with two or more running virtual machines in Unity mode.\nWorkaround: Reduce the number of virtual machines running in Unity mode by suspending or exiting Unity mode on other machines.\nWhen running a Fedora 20 virtual machine in full screen, the display might use an incorrect resolution.\nWorkaround: Uninstall and reinstall the latest version of VMware Tools.\nFor restricted virtual machines configured to verify time with a server, the warning message displayed when the server is not available shows an incorrect time remaining.\nIn some cases, a remote virtual machine’s CD drive disables itself when connected to a local image.\nWorkaround: Upload the image to the remote datastore and connect to the image there.\nA USB webcam might fail to connect when used with the virtual camera device in a Windows 7 or OSX virtual machine.\nWorkaround: Connect the camera to the virtual machine with USB. By default, cameras do not appear in the USB devices list. To show them, edit the file ~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/config (It is a text file; create it if needed.) and add the line: \nvusbcamera.passthrough = “TRUE”\nQuit and restart Fusion. Then select the camera to pass to the virtual machine in the USB settings panel.\nDisabling “Connect At Power On” option in the Network Adaptor setting panel on a powered off remote virtual machine might revert to the enabled state.\nWorkaround: Power the virtual machine on and then disable the option.\nOpen VMware Tools included in some recent versions of Linux, such as CentOS 7, might prevent file sharing (HGFS), drag-and-drop, or cut and paste from working correctly.\nWorkaround: Uninstall the open-vm-tools package and install the latest version of the included VMware Tools.\nOccasionally, the UI performance of a Yosemite virtual machine is poor with slow window and menu updates\nExpanding a virtual hard drive connected to a remote virtual machine fails with a warning of \"A specified parameter was not correct.\"\nWorkaround: Create a new virtual hard drive in the desired size, copy the files, and then remove the old virtual hard drive.\nRemoving a virtual hard drive from a remote virtual machine fails without an error or warning.\nThis is a known limitation of remote virtual machines with snapshots. To remove the drive, delete all snapshots.\nThere can be a significant delay between selecting the “Install McAfee AntiVirus Plus” menu item and the installation CD appearing in the virtual machine.\nOccasionally, changing the scaled resolution option in the Display settings panel with a running virtual machine results in incorrect mouse positioning or incorrect scaling.\nWorkaround: To avoid this issue, shutdown the virtual machine before adjusting the scaled resolution option.\nIn some circumstances, when entering Unity on a multi-monitor configuration, the window contents show as gray rectangles instead of correct content.\nInteracting with the window causes the content to update to the correct state.\nFor some multi-monitor configurations, scaled full screen view mode fails to display correctly.\nScaled full screen mode sometimes does not work well with Ubuntu 14.04.1.\nSwitching a virtual machine to Unity mode on a MacBook Pro with Retina display and two external displays, the virtual machine enters into Unity mode but displays flashing window content.\nTo exit the state, leave Unity mode. To prevent recurrence, disconnect one of the external displays or disable the “Use full resolution for Retina display” checkbox in the Display settings panel.\nWith “Use full resolution for Retina display” enabled or when running on Yosemite preview builds, Unity windows might not display correctly in Expose.\nWhen running on Yosemite preview builds, changing the full screen mode option from “Use Single Display in Full Screen” to “Use All Displays in Full Screen” while in full screen mode can fail with some monitors displaying black.\nWorkaround: To resolve the issue, exit and re-enter full screen mode.\nIn some cases on Windows 8.1, the PC Migration Agent does not automatically launch after restarting the PC to be imported.\nWorkaround: If this occurs, locate and launch the PC Migration Agent manually.\nA Windows XP virtual machine cannot be set to a resolution larger than 2560 x 1920.\nTo avoid this issue, downgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 10 in the Compatibility settings panel.\nWhen running an OS X virtual machine with a shared folder mapped to a folder on a server, opening .dmg files already open by another application fails with the message “The following disk image couldn't be opened - Reason Input/Output error.”\nWorkaround: Ensure that the files are not open from another application or copy the files to a local folder and share that with the virtual machine.\nDragging and dropping a file from the guest to a host folder with a large number of non-ASCII characters in the folder or path name can crash the guest OS.\nWorkaround: This can be avoided by renaming the folder and parent folders so that they have less than 58 non-ASCII characters total in their names.\nWith three monitors connected and “Use full resolution for Retina Display” enabled, entering Unity can fail either by reverting to single window mode or extended display flicker. \nWorkaround: To prevent this, either remove a display or disable “Use full resolution for Retina Display.”\nWith three monitors connected, “Use full resolution for Retina Display” enabled and scaled resolution enabled for Full Screen, entering Full Screen can fail either by reverting to single window mode or mirroring a single display across the monitors. \nTo prevent this, either remove a display, disable “Use full resolution for Retina Display,” or disable scaled resolution enabled for Full Screen.\nSending a file over Bluetooth can fail if the “Share Bluetooth devices with Windows” checkbox has been disabled and re-enabled without rebooting the virtual machine. \nWorkaround: Reboot the virtual machine.\nWhen prompted for the admin password after downloading VMware Tools or McAfee AntiVirus Plus, if you click into a virtual machine window, the mouse cursor might disappear or lock up. \nTo exit this state, press Command-Tab to switch to another application, and then Command-Tab again until you switch back to VMware Fusion.\nIn some Linux virtual machines, changing the networking type from NAT to bridged (or visa versa) can fail to reset networking stack and result in stale networking information, including the IP address.\nWorkaround: Disconnect and reconnect the network adaptor by disabling and re-enabling the “Connect Network Adaptor” check box in the Network Adaptor settings pane.\nWhen connected to an instance of VMware Workstation hosting remote virtual machines, the status pane shows 0 RAM and CPU usage.\nWhile running Fusion on Yosemite pre-release builds, changing values in the “Default Applications” panel in settings might appear to fail. \nPressing “Show All” and then returning to the “Default Applications” panel refreshes the values shown.\nWhen running a Debian 6 virtual machine in Unity, window dragging might fail. \nWorkaround: Exit Unity and use the virtual machine in Full Screen or single window mode.\nCopying files from a USB 3 flash drive connected to an OS X virtual machine with a USB 3.0 controller can fail and cause the flash drive to connect from both the virtual machine and host. \nTo avoid this, connect the flash drive to the host and then map the drive into the virtual machine with folder sharing.\nWith some Linux virtual machines, suspending a virtual machine might fail with the error “The request to Suspend this virtual machine failed because the corresponding VMware Tools script did not run successfully.” \nWorkaround: Uninstalling and then reinstalling the tools might resolve this issue.\nSome USB WiFi adaptors might fail to reconnect after sleeping and resuming the host machine.\nWorkaround: Unplugging and re-inserting the adaptor might resolve this issue.\nScreen updates of Office 2013 applications might be slow.\nChecking the “Disable hardware graphics acceleration” checkbox in Options for each application might improve performance.\nEnlarging a virtual hard disk on a remote virtual machine fails.\nThis operation is not supported on remote virtual machines. To add more drive space, create a new hard disk of the desired size, copy the files, and then remove the old disk.\nEasy install for some Linux distributions fails if the virtual machine’s name includes $0.\nWorkaround: Do not include $0 in the virtual machine’s name.\nAudio and video quality when using video conferencing from within a virtual machine might be poor.\nWorkaround: Using a headset might mitigate the audio issue.\nExporting a virtual machine to OVF or OVA fails when specifying a really long file name or a file name that includes non-alpha numeric characters. \nWorkaround: To avoid the issue, chose a name shorter than 240 characters with only letters, numbers, and spaces.\nUsing a USB headset with a virtual machine with a USB 3 controller can fail. \nWorkaround: Reconfiguring the USB controller to a USB 2 controller in the “Advanced USB Options” in the USB and Bluetooth settings panel might resolve this issue.\nAfter sleeping and awakening the host Mac, guest audio might fail with an error message “”. \nWorkaround: Suspending and resuming the virtual machine might restore the audio.\nShared folders in a running OS X virtual machine might fail to copy files with the error “The item <file_name> can't be copied because there isn't enough free space.” \nWorkaround: Rebooting the virtual machine without changing the Shared Folder settings should resolve this issue.\nWhen creating a virtual machine with a name that includes accented characters, the Removable Devices section of the Settings window might not be visible.\nWorkaround: Quitting and restarting Fusion resolves this issue.\nSome applications fail to launch from a Unity docker or the Fusion application menu.\nThe applications launch correctly from the Windows Start Menu or by double clicking on the application within Windows.\nOn some remote virtual machines, the Shut Down option is disabled.\nWorkaround: To power off the virtual machine, press the Option key and select “Force Shutdown.”\nRemote virtual machines do not automatically resize the virtual machine’s video when going into Full Screen or when the window is resized.\nWorkaround: To resize the virtual machine’s video, use the UI within the virtual machine’s operating system.\nWhen operating with multiple versions of Fusion installed, you might see an issue where starting a virtual machine fails with an “Internal Error.” \nThis issue can be resolved by restarting the Mac.\nCutting and pasting a file from the Mac into Outlook running in a Windows virtual machine can fail.\nWorkaround: This can be avoided by pasting the file onto the Windows desktop and then attaching it to the email within Outlook.\nRunning a virtual machine stored on an external NTFS formatted volume fails with a non-specific error.\nWorkaround: Moving the virtual machine to an HFS formatted volume avoids this error.\nSome UI elements in Adobe Photoshop might not render correctly when running within a OS X virtual machine. \nWorkaround: This can be remedied by disabling the virtual machine’s accelerated video driver. To do so, open the Terminal application inside the virtual machine and type:\nsudo nvram boot-args='vmw_gfx_caps=0'\nPress return and enter the virtual machine’s admin password. Then reboot the virtual machine.\nConnecting a USB 3 device to a USB 3 hub while Fusion is running might not show the device to either the Mac or the virtual machine.\nWorkaround: To avoid this, plug the device directly into the Mac.\nWhen passed through to a virtual machine, some USB devices, such as iPads and iPhones, might not recharge their batteries.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"02/09/2014","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"02/09/2014","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"02/09/2014","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"02/09/2014","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion Pro has been updated for OS X Yosemite.

{"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ReleaseContents":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.\nThese release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nThis release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features.\nNew Installation Experience\nDesigned for Mountain Lion\nWindows 8 Optimized\nOptimized for the latest Macs\nUser Interface Changes\nVirtual Hardware Changes\nOther Changes\nNew Installation Experience\nThe installation media for VMware Fusion have been simplified. Simply launch the VMware Fusion.app from the media or download file to install and upgrade VMware Fusion. Dragging and dropping, then launching VMware Fusion.app is also supported.\nVMware Fusion can be uninstalled by quitting the application and dragging it to the trash.\nDesigned for Mountain Lion\nVMware Fusion 5 was designed with OS X Mountain Lion in mind to give users a more Mac-like experience in running Windows programs on a Mac. Search your favorite Windows programs in Launchpad or use \"AirPlay Mirroring\" to stream your Mac and Windows applications on your HDTV. VMware Fusion uses Mountain Lion's notification center to display important messages. VMware Fusion 5 also works with OS X Lion and Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.7 required.)\nWindows 8 Optimized\nWho said Windows 8 was for PCs? Get the most out of the new Windows 8-style \"Metro\" applications using VMware Fusion 5 and Mountain Lion full-screen mode.\nVMware Fusion 5 has been optimized to take advantage of new Windows 8 technologies and will make you wonder why you would ever consider running Windows 8 on anything other than a Mac. VMware Fusion supports Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Enterprise and includes a keyboard profile tailored for Windows 8.\nVMware Fusion 5 also supports running Windows 8 from a Boot Camp partition.\nOptimized for the latest Macs\nGet the benefits of your new Mac with your Windows programs too. Crisp and detailed Windows applications like you've never seen before with Retina Display support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.\nExtend your Mac's connectivity to your Windows environment and take advantage of USB 3.0 support when used with Windows 8 and recent versions of Linux with USB 3.0 support.\nVMware Fusion 5 takes advantage of faster memory and faster SSD performance found in the latest Macs to deliver an experience that feels as fast as native. VMware Fusion 5 has been tuned to feel snappier and more responsive even on older Macs.\nVMware Fusion 5 has been updated to provide longer battery life, particularly when the virtual machine is being lightly used.\nUser Interface Changes\nThe VMware Fusion 5 user interface has been refined to provide a more productive working environment that works well with OSX Mountain Lion. The changes include:\nNew Virtual Machine Library, updated with a choice of both icon and list views appropriate for small laptop displays and large desktop configurations. Both with active thumbnail displays.\nThe ability to create folders within the library to organize large collections of virtual machines.\nSee disk utilization and other key information directly from the virtual machine library, easing day-to-day management especially on space constrained SSD-based systems.\nNew handling of Settings and Snapshot windows making it easier to make tweaks and changes while continuing to work in the virtual machine.\nNew take and restore snapshot buttons can optionally be added to the virtual machine tool bar, making working with snapshots much more efficient.\nThe redesigned Welcome experience makes it easier for new users to get up and running.\nThe VMware Fusion Learning Center can now be accessed directly from VMware Fusion and has been updated with new video content for this release.\nVirtual Hardware Changes\nAs always, VMware continues to improve our virtual hardware performance and capabilities with the following:\nVMware Fusion 5 now provides support for 3D Linux desktops when running recent versions of Linux. These enable a full-fidelity desktop experience on compatible distributions such as Ubuntu 12.04.\nVMware Fusion 5 now supports OS X Mountain Lion in a virtual machine. Get more from your Mac by running OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mountain Lion Server, OS X Lion and OS X Lion Server in virtual machines. VMware Fusion 5 is the best way to develop and test new applications for the Mac and iOS.\nAdded support for virtualizing Windows 8 (all Intel versions), VMware ESXi 5, Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 17 and Windows Server 2012.\nImproved support for virtualized VT-x/EPT.\nVirtual Performance Counter support is included to enable more detailed software profiling within a virtual machine.\nImproved support for running multiple virtual machines on Macs with 16GB RAM or more.\nThe VIX API is now included for automating common tasks using PERL or other scripting languages.\nVMware Fusion 5 can now run restricted virtual machines. Restricted virtual machines are pre-configured and provide a streamlined experience for VMware Fusion users in a business environment.\nVMware Fusion 5 Professional can create and run restricted virtual machines. IT professionals can create restricted virtual machines to deliver applications to users in a tested and supported configuration.\nOther Changes\nVMware Fusion 5 Professional now includes a custom network configuration tool for creating specialized virtual networks for demos, home labs and testing purposes.\nVMware Fusion 5 is now able to directly import many OVF format virtual machines.\nInitial support for network booting EFI-based virtual machines is included.\nA meta-package (mpkg) is included for deploying VMware Fusion to a large number of Macs using system administration tools such as Apple Remote Desktop.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe following issues might occur in VMware Fusion 5.0.\nWhen importing the Boot Camp partition to a virtual machine, an error message appears\nWhen you import the Boot Camp partition to a virtual machine, you receive the error message VMware Fusion is unable to prepare your virtual machine. This problem occurs when Fusion is unable to apply settings to the Windows registry needed to run the imported Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.\nWhen saving documents to a FAT32 format drive in Office 2010, a Directory in Use error is seen\nA Directory in Use error is received when saving documents to a FAT32 format drive (through Shared Folders) in Office 2010. This occurs when you are using Office applications to create and save files to shared folders. This usually occurs with externally attached drives, such as a USB drive. This also occurs with Microsoft SMB shares to that same location when used by Office from a remote Windows PC.\nWorkaround: Use the Office application to save and create files to a share located on the host internal drive or any drive not formatted for FAT, for example, Mac OS Extended (using Finder Get Info on the volume). Then copy the resulting file to the FAT drive.\nVirtual machine view mode might not revert from snapshot\nIf you take a virtual machine snapshot in one view mode (Single Window/Unity/Full Screen) and switch to another view mode, the virtual machine view might not revert from snapshot. While the virtual machine restores the snapshot, the view mode may not revert to the original mode.\nWorkaround: Use the Fusion Menu or shortcuts to change the view mode manually.\nUnable to boot a virtual machine from some USB 3.0 devices on MacBook Air 5.1\nYou might be unable to boot a virtual machine from some USB 3.0 devices on MacBook Air 5.1.\nWhen attaching a USB 3.0 device, you might see the error message The device 'XXX' was unable to connect to its ideal host controller. An attempt will be made to connect this device to the available host controller. This might result in undefined behavior for this device.\nYou can ignore the error message and finish installing the guest OS on the USB device. However, after restarting the virtual machine, the USB 3.0 device does not show up on the Boot Menu.\nWorkaround: Use a USB 2.0 device as a replacement.\nCannot install the complimentary McAfee Anti-Virus software on Windows 8\nThe bundled McAfee Anti-Virus introductory subscription cannot be installed on Windows 8. The Install McAfee Anti-Virus Plus menu item is not available. The McAfee installer bundled with VMware Fusion 5 does not support Windows 8 and does not install on this version of Microsoft Windows.\nWorkaround: If you require Anti-Virus protection, you can use an alternative anti-virus product that supports Windows 8.\nNetBooted Mac OS X guest might fail to reboot\nA NetBooted Mac OS X guest can fail to boot from the network when the guest OS is restarted.\nWorkaround: A cold start of the virtual machine is required to reinitialize the virtual Ethernet adapter.\nUnity mode not available for certain Linux desktops\nWhen you power on any guest using the Ubuntu Unity desktop environment (Ubuntu 11.10+), the Unity menu and Unity tool bar appears disabled. Unity is also disabled for guests using Compiz and Enlightenment window managers.\nThere are miscolored graphics on Windows 8 welcome screen running on a Retina display equipped Mac in Full Screen mode\nIn certain configurations the login screen might be overlaid on the welcome screen, resulting in incorrect colors. Once you begin the login process, the colors will appear correctly.\nElements of the Windows 8-style application mode are not available in Windows 8\nCertain features of Windows 8-style applications (formerly Metro) are not available when in Unity mode (e.g. charms menu).\nWorkaround: Switch to single-window mode or full-screen mode to access these features.\nOpen weblinks in guest using Mac applications does not work correctly with Windows 8\nSoftware can no longer programmatically set URL handlers in Windows 8.\nWorkaround: Associate http and https with VMwareHostOpen.exe using the Windows Control Panel.\nOS X virtual machines are limited to a 16MB video frame buffer\nThis limits the maximum resolution of OS X in a virtual machine to approximately 2560x1600.\nCreating a custom virtual network with mismatched IP address and net mask may result in an unusable virtual network. \nImproved validation will be included in a future release of VMware Fusion.\nPreview versions of Microsoft Office 2013 might experience graphics rendering issues when running in a virtual machine\nWhen a video card is set to enable 3D acceleration, Microsoft Office 2013 applications fail to correctly render graphics.\nWorkaround: Disable 3D acceleration.\nWhile a Linux virtual machine is in Unity mode, the Tools service stops working after Mission Control operations\nWhen a Linux virtual machine runs in Unity mode, the mission control operations (such as show Mission Control, Application windows, Desktop, and Dashboard view) causes the Tools service in the virtual machine to stop working. With Tools functionaly no longer available, the virtual machine cannot, for example, auto-fit its resolution after resizing the virtual machine window, and files cannot be dragged and dropped between the host and the guest. This problem is known to occur on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.3, openSUSE12.1, Ubuntu 11.10 virtual machines, and might occur on virtual machines with other Linux distributions installed.\nWorkaround: Restart the virtual machine.\nWhile uninstalling the Windows 8 guest operating system tools, you encounter a black screen on the virtual machine\nWhen you uninstall the Windows 8 guest operation system tools, you might encounter a black screen on the virtual machine. This is due to a driver issue.\nWorkaround: Wait a few minutes for the display to recover. The uninstallation of the tools should be successful once the display recoveres and should prompt you for a restart of the virtual machine.\nSuspending and resuming a virtual machine while installing McAfee VirusScan Plus causes the McAfee installation to fail and causes the Tools installer to launch unexpectedly\nOn a Windows virtual machine, when installing McAfee VirusScan Plus, if you suspend and then resume the virtual machine while the installation wizard for McAfee is open, the installation of McAfee cannot continue and the Tools installer launches. This occurs because the the McAfee installer ISO image is incorrectly unmounted and the Tools installer ISO image is mounted instead.\nWorkaround: Cancel the Tools installation and restart the virtual machine.\nThe Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications virtual machine setting is not supported in Windows 8\nThe Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications setting in the virtual machine Default Application settings is not supported for Windows 8 guest operating systems. If in Fusion you set Virtual Machine > Settings > Default Applications > Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications and then open a Windows 8 virtual machine, the setting does not change Windows 8 settings and weblinks are opened by the default application in Windows 8.\nWorkaround: In Windows 8, open Default Programs > Set Default Programs and select Default Host Application. Click Choose default associations to manually set which file types the host should open.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes."},{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"This release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"This release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features."},{"entry":"New Installation Experience","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Installation Experience"},{"entry":"Designed for Mountain Lion","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Designed for Mountain Lion"},{"entry":"Windows 8 Optimized","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Windows 8 Optimized"},{"entry":"Optimized for the latest Macs","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Optimized for the latest Macs"},{"entry":"User Interface Changes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"User Interface Changes"},{"entry":"Virtual Hardware Changes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Virtual Hardware Changes"},{"entry":"Other Changes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Other Changes"},{"entry":"New Installation Experience","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.0","ReleaseDate":"23/08/2012","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Installation Experience"},{"entry":"The installation media for VMware Fusion have been simplified.

You will be prompted for your system password the first time you run VMware Fusion. vmrun can be used to start VMware Fusion after that.\nThe McAfee Antivirus .iso is removed during AutoUpdate of VMware Fusion if no newer version of the .iso is available.\nWorkaround: Download the McAfee Antivirus .iso.\nIf you installed the VMware Fusion April 2011 Beta or the VMware Fusion June 2011 Beta and then installed VMware Fusion 4.0, the VMware Fusion Help might not display when you click context-sensitive help links from the Fusion user interface.\nWorkaround: Clear the cache for the Help files.\nDelete the following files:\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\nEmpty the Trash.\nRestart VMware Fusion.\nIt might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.\nGuest Operating Systems\nWhen upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.\nWorkaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at \"Migrating OD to 10.7\", perform the following steps:\nPress Cmd-Q in the guest and click the \"Shut Down\" button.\nAdd a second processor core to the virtual machine.\nThe guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.\nWhen configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.\nWorkaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.\nBootcamp\nHibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.\nWorkaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\plugins\\vmsvc.\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nWhen Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.\nUsing Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.\nWorkaround: None.\nIf you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.\nWorkaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.\nIf you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.\nWorkaround: None.\nGraphics\nAdding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.\nWorkaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.\nWorkaround: Try any of the following setting changes.\nChange Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).\nChange Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.\nChange the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.\nGraphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.\nWorkaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.\nIn Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.\nGraphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nSome older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.\nWorkaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.\nSome applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.\nFolders\nIf a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.\nWorkaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.\nIn a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. \nWorkaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nThe application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.\nWorkaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.\nIn Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.\nWorkaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.\nSwitching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.\nWorkaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.\nIf you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.\nWorkaround: None.\nVirtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.\nWorkaround: None.\nHiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.\nWorkaround: None.\nNetwork Configuration\nIn a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.\nWorkaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.\nOn a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.\nWorkaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.\nVirtual Machine Power States\nIf you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nIf CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.\nWorkaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.\nYou can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.\nWorkaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.\nLocalization\nThe VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.\nWorkaround:\nRemove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:\ncom.apple.help.plist\ncom.apple.helpui.plist\ncom.apple.helpviewer.plist\nRemove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:\ncom.apple.helpui folder\ncom.apple.helpdata\nEmpty the Trash.\nReboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.\nRemovable Devices\nHDAudio device is added by default to new Windows Vista and Windows 7 virtual machines only.\nWorkaround: For existing Vista and Windows 7 virtual machines with sound devices that are upgraded to hardware version 8, remove the existing sound device and add a new one in order to switch to HDAudio.\nEuropean keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences.

{"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ReleaseContents":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.\nThese release notes include the following topics.\nUpdates in VMware Fusion 4.1\nInstallation Notes\nPC Migration Notes\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 4\nResolved Issues\nKnown Issues\nUpdates in VMware Fusion 4.1\nVMware Fusion 4.1 is a free, minor upgrade recommended for all users of VMware Fusion 4. This release includes the following new features and improvements.\nSmart Full Screen\nFull screen mode provides better productivity and consistency with Mac OS X Lion than previous versions.\nThe Lion full-screen button is used in virtual machine windows.\nThe Lion full-screen keyboard shortcut (Cmd-Control-F) is now supported in addition to Cmd-Control-Return.\nLike other full screen Lion applications, a VMware Fusion virtual machine moves to a new full screen space when using a single display.\nIf you are using multiple displays, VMware Fusion intelligently decides whether to use a full screen space or not. If the virtual machine is configured to use all displays in full screen, it moves to a full screen space. If not, full screen takes the whole display in the current space, which enables you to work in other Mac applications while the virtual machine makes full use of the secondary display.\nThe VMware Fusion menu bar and toolbar are now accessible from Full Screen mode. A short delay in showing the menu allows access the top of the virtual machine screen, particularly when running Mac OS X Lion in a virtual machine.\nA redesigned, compact minibar that you can drag for quick access to common actions without leaving Full Screen mode.\nAutomatic virtual machine power on\nVirtual machines can now be powered on automatically when VMware Fusion starts. You can override this setting by holding Shift when VMware Fusion starts. This feature was removed in VMware Fusion 4 but is now available in VMware Fusion 4.1 in the General settings for every virtual machine.\nImproved animations\nImproved animations for full screen mode, unity mode, library and snapshots.\nFast screen resizing and improved startup time\nFaster screen resizing (Microsoft Hotfix 2522761 recommended), faster transitions into Unity and Full Screen modes, and improved startup time with Windows 7 virtual machines.\nImproved Mac OS X Lion guest operating system support\nImproved Mac OS X Lion virtual machine support including smoother mouse movements and support for File Vault 2 when using Mac OS X 10.7.2 or later. Upated VMware Tools disable sleep on older versions of Mac OS X virtual machines.\nImproved graphics performance\nImproved graphics performance and correctness for Internet Explorer 9 and Solidworks 2012 and improved graphics performance when using Mac OS X 10.7.2.\nVMware Fusion 4.1 also resolves the following issues:\nAn intermittent problem when plugging in a new USB device that resulted in error 4.\nImproved support for resizing NTFS formatted disks.\nAn intermittent issue connecting USB devices attached via a Thunderbolt display.\nAn intermittent issue installing Mac OS X Lion from physical media.\nImproved compatibility of shared folders for many applications.\nAn issue installing VMware Tools on Ubuntu 11.10 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7.\nA graphics rendering issue on some Mac Pro systems with very large amounts of memory\nA graphics rendering issue specific to some non-English languages.\nAn intermittent problem when using the migration assistant on Mac OS X 10.7.2.\nSpurious activation messages when using Boot Camp virtual machines on some systems.\nTop of Page\nInstallation Notes\nThe hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0. This version of VMware Fusion requires a 64-bit CPU. Macs containing Intel Core Solo and Core Duo processors are no longer supported. Mac OS X 10.6.7 or higher is required to use VMware Fusion. See the system requirements in Getting Started with VMware Fusion for more details.\nInstall VMware Fusion 4.1 by dragging the VMware Fusion application icon to a folder on your Mac. The VMware Fusion application can be dragged to the Applications folder or to another location on your Mac. If you are running a previous version of VMware Fusion, double-click the Upgrade icon instead of dragging the application icon.\nVMware Tools Installation\nAll users should upgrade VMware Tools after installing VMware Fusion 4.1 to obtain all the fixes in this release.\nIn order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion \"light\" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.\nIf you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).\nMcAfee VirusScan for Mac\nIf you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.\nTo prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.\nOn your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.\nClick Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.\nClick More Options.\nSelect Click lock to make changes.\nSelect Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.\nSelect the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.\nLock your changes and close the window.\nThe virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.\nTop of Page\nPC Migration Notes\nFor some best practices and troubleshooting information, see \"Migration Assistant: A Guide\" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.\nVMware Fusion Migrate Your PC\nThe Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7 Lion.\nThe VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.\nBefore migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.\nIn the Control Panel, click Power Options.\nOn the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.\nBefore migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.\nThe Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.\nIf you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.\nThe simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.\nRight-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.\nSelect the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.\nYou must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.\nIf you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.\nWorkaround: Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nMigrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.\nAfter migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.\nStart the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.\nDownload a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).\nChange the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nTools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.\nTop of Page\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 4\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion are described in the release notes for each release, along with existing known issues. In addition, the release notes contain information on system requirements and installation. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 4, click the following links:\nVMware Fusion 4.0.2\nVMware Fusion 4.0.1\nVMware Fusion 4.0\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThe following issues are resolved in this release.\nVMware Tools failed with the message VMware Tools unrecoverable error.\nVMware Tools failed to start in Fedora 15 guests.\nAn Ubuntu 11.10 guest crashed with a signal 11 error if you installed or upgraded VMware Tools.\nOn hosts with Nvidia GeForce and Quadro video cards, some of the clouds in the Unigine Heaven Benchmark application were drawn solid black.\nEasy Install did not properly function on Ubuntu 11.10.\nMac OS X guests did not treat virtual disks as internal devices.\nImporting a Boot Camp partition into a standalone virtual machine occasionally caused a system crash on Mac OS X 10.7.\nThe com.vmware.kext.vmnet kernel extension could cause a kernel panic when quitting VMware Fusion.\nInstalling Mac OS X Lion as a guest from an Apple OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive sometimes failed.\nIn virtual machines with Windows XP guests with any Mirrored Folder enabled, any host-side changes to a file or folder were not reflected automatically by the mirrored folder in the guest if the guest user was not an administrator.\nDragging multiple files from the host to a virtual machine caused VMware Fusion to crash.\nThe Aladdin Knowledge HASP dongle did not work properly after upgrading VMware Tools.\nAdded support for FileVault full-disk encryption in Mac OS X 10.7.2 and later guests. Using FileVault is not recommended for versions of Mac OS X 10.7 prior to 10.7.2.\nVMware Fusion failed to initialize and showed the message VMware Fusion is damaged and could not be repaired if modifications had been made to the host's root account.\nVMware Tools installation failed with the error VM communication interface: [FAILED].\nUsing a non-English region or language setting in System Preferences caused videos to appear solid black in Windows virtual machines.\nIn some cases, a partition was not automatically resized for a virtual disk with single NTFS partition after the Disk Size setting was changed.\nVMware Fusion crashed on startup if parts of the VMware Fusion application bundle had incorrect permissions.\nVirtual machines showed a black screen on computers with more than 32GB of memory.\nSome pen tablets, such as the Wacom Intuos 4, responded with erratic mouse behavior.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe known issues are grouped as follows:\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nGuest Operating Systems\nBootcamp\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nGraphics\nFolders\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nNetwork Configuration\nVirtual Machine Power States\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nLocalization\nRemovable Devices\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nStarting VMware Fusion with the command vmrun does not work for the first time after installation.\nWorkaround: Double-click the VMware Fusion .app file to start VMware Fusion for the first time. You will be prompted for your system password the first time you run VMware Fusion. vmrun can be used to start VMware Fusion after that.\nThe McAfee Antivirus .iso is removed during AutoUpdate of VMware Fusion if no newer version of the .iso is available.\nWorkaround: Download the McAfee Antivirus .iso.\nIf you installed the VMware Fusion April 2011 Beta or the VMware Fusion June 2011 Beta and then installed VMware Fusion 4.0, the VMware Fusion Help might not display when you click context-sensitive help links from the Fusion user interface.\nWorkaround: Clear the cache for the Help files.\nDelete the following files:\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\nEmpty the Trash.\nRestart VMware Fusion.\nIt might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.\nGuest Operating Systems\nWhen upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.\nWorkaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at \"Migrating OD to 10.7\", perform the following steps:\nPress Cmd-Q in the guest and click the \"Shut Down\" button.\nAdd a second processor core to the virtual machine.\nThe guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.\nWhen configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.\nWorkaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.\nBootcamp\nHibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.\nWorkaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\plugins\\vmsvc.\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nWhen Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.\nUsing Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.\nWorkaround: None.\nIf you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.\nWorkaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.\nIf you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.\nWorkaround: None.\nGraphics\nAdding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.\nWorkaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.\nWorkaround: Try any of the following setting changes.\nChange Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).\nChange Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.\nChange the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.\nGraphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.\nWorkaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.\nIn Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.\nGraphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nSome older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.\nWorkaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.\nSome applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.\nFolders\nIf a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.\nWorkaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.\nIn a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. \nWorkaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nThe application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.\nWorkaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.\nIn Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.\nWorkaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.\nSwitching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.\nWorkaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.\nIf you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.\nWorkaround: None.\nVirtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.\nWorkaround: None.\nHiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.\nWorkaround: None.\nNetwork Configuration\nIn a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.\nWorkaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.\nOn a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.\nWorkaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.\nVirtual Machine Power States\nIf you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nIf CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.\nWorkaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.\nYou can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.\nWorkaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.\nLocalization\nThe VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.\nWorkaround:\nRemove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:\ncom.apple.help.plist\ncom.apple.helpui.plist\ncom.apple.helpviewer.plist\nRemove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:\ncom.apple.helpui folder\ncom.apple.helpdata\nEmpty the Trash.\nReboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.\nRemovable Devices\nHDAudio device is added by default to new Windows Vista and Windows 7 virtual machines only.\nWorkaround: For existing Vista and Windows 7 virtual machines with sound devices that are upgraded to hardware version 8, remove the existing sound device and add a new one in order to switch to HDAudio.\nEuropean keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences. Sending keys such as @, {, }, and others to Windows does not work as it does on the Mac.\nWorkaround: Only German and French keyboards are supported.\nIf you use a USB headset connected from the host to the guest, you will hear some glitches.\nWorkaround: None.\nPrinting multiple copies of a document from the guest on a USB printer that is connected to the host does not work. If you attempt to print multiple copies from a guest on a USB printer, only one copy is printed.\nWorkaround: Connect the USB printer to the guest directly. Alternatively, connect the printer to the host using network mode. \nSome pen tablets, such as the Wacom Intuos 4, experience erratic mouse behavior.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes."},{"entry":"These release notes include the following topics.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes include the following topics."},{"entry":"Updates in VMware Fusion 4.1","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Updates in VMware Fusion 4.1"},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"PC Migration Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"PC Migration Notes"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 4","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 4"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"Updates in VMware Fusion 4.1","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"17/11/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Updates in VMware Fusion 4.1"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 4.1 is a free, minor upgrade recommended for all users of VMware Fusion 4.

{"VersionNumber":"4.0.2","ReleaseDate":"27/09/2011","ReleaseContents":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.\nThese release notes include the following topics.\nInstallation Notes\nWhat's New\nUpdates in VMware Fusion 4.0.2\nPC Migration Notes\nKnown Issues\nInstallation Notes\nThe hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0. This version of VMware Fusion requires a 64-bit CPU. Macs containing Intel Core Solo and Core Duo processors are no longer supported. Mac OS X 10.6.7 or higher is required to use VMware Fusion. See the system requirements in Getting Started with VMware Fusion for more details.\nInstall VMware Fusion 4 by dragging the VMware Fusion application icon to a folder on your Mac. The VMware Fusion application can be dragged to the Applications folder or to another location on your Mac. If you are running a previous version of VMware Fusion, double-click the Upgrade icon instead of dragging the application icon.\nVMware Tools Installation\nIn order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion \"light\" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.\nIf you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).\nMcAfee VirusScan for Mac\nIf you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.\nTo prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.\nOn your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.\nClick Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.\nClick More Options.\nSelect Click lock to make changes.\nSelect Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.\nSelect the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.\nLock your changes and close the window.\nThe virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.\nTop of Page\nWhat's New\nThis release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features.\nNew Installation Experience\nNew User Interface\nDesigned for Lion\nVirtual Hardware Improvements\nEncrypted Virtual Machines\nPause State for Virtual Machines\nRemote CD and DVD Drives\nShrinking Disks with Snapshots\nMirrored Folders\nOVF Support\nOther Technical Changes\nNew Installation Experience\nVMware Fusion is now installed by dragging and dropping to the Applications folder. Users of older versions can upgrade using the included utility. VMware Fusion can be uninstalled by quitting the application and dragging it to the trash.\nNew User Interface\nVMware Fusion includes a new user interface designed to maximize screen space dedicated to running virtual machines. By keeping the interface minimal, we have improved user productivity for Windows applications. It is now more consistent with the overall Mac desktop experience than previous versions of VMware Fusion.\nThe new user interface includes the following key features.\nThe Single-window experience is optimized around each running virtual machine, keeping related options and settings together. A new collapsible toolbar provides quick access to common virtual machine actions including switching networks, connecting and disconnecting devices, and sharing options. The Control-Alt-Delete key combination is now available as a menu button.\nThe Virtual Machine Library Welcome screen has been refreshed to make it easier to get up and running quickly.\nThe Virtual Machine Library is updated with thumbnails of virtual machine desktops and shortcuts to common activities.\nThe Settings have been redesigned to make it easier to perform common tasks. New settings subsections for Compatibility, Default Applications and Startup Disk are included.\nThe Snapshot viewer provides powerful new features for working with snapshots using a timeline-based view, inspired by Time Machine.\nDesigned for Lion\nVMware Fusion 4 is designed for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and includes support for using Mission Control to switch between Mac and Windows applications. Support for Spaces and Exposé has also been improved to make it easier to switch between applications.\nMac OS X Lion and Mac OS X Lion Server are now supported as guest operating systems. Mac OS X Lion can be installed by dragging the Lion installer icon to the virtual machine wizard.\nVirtual Hardware Improvements\nAs always, VMware continues to improve our virtual hardware performance and capabilities. You must upgrade the hardware version of your existing VMs or create a new VM in order to get the best features and performance from your virtual machines. Upgrade the hardware version of your virtual machine from the new virtual machine settings page under Compatibility.\nAn HD Audio device is available for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and OS X 10.7 guests. The new HD Audio device takes advantage of the latest sound drivers and produces high sound quality even under heavy load.\nBluetooth devices on the host can now be shared with Windows and Mac OS X guests. Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth phone, are paired to either the host system or to a virtual machine. VMware does not recommend pairing Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones, or Bluetooth input devices, such as keyboards and mice to a guest.\nLink-state propagation enables applications to seamlessly communicate when using NAT-based networking even when moving between networks. For example, communication between applications will continue seamlessly when you move from a wired network to a wireless network.\nOur graphics team continues to improve rendering correctness and to tune our graphics drivers. VMware Fusion 4 is up to 2.5 times faster than VMware Fusion 3 for some 3D operations. Improved support for AutoCAD, SolidWorks and Altium Designer on Windows XP and Windows 7 is also included.\nEncrypted Virtual Machines\nVMware Fusion now enables security best practices by providing virtual disk encryption using industry-standard AES-128. Encryption can require a per-virtual-machine password whenever the virtual machine is powered on.\nPause State for Virtual Machines\nThe new Pause state suspends the virtual machine while retaining the in-memory state. This state can be useful when system resources will temporarily be taxed and the guest virtual machine is not immediately needed.\nRemote CD and DVD Drives\nRemote CD and DVD drives shared from another Windows PC or Mac are supported for installing operating systems on virtual machines.\nShrinking Disks with Snapshots\nVMware Fusion now supports shrinking virtual disks without the need to remove the snapshots first. Shrinking virtual disks without removing snapshots allows users to maintain their virtual machines and reclaim disk space more easily than in previous releases of VMware Fusion. Look for the new virtual machine clean up capability under the General section of the virtual machine settings.\nMirrored Folders\nDownloads and Movies folders are now mirrored from the Mac.\nOVF Support\nSupport for creating OVF-format virtual machines is provided by the standalone OVF tool. This tool is available for download from: http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/server/vsphere/automationtools/ovf?view=overview\nOther Technical Changes\nVMware Fusion 4 is now 64-bit throughout. In addition, services and kernel extensions are loaded and unloaded on-demand. The application can now be run from non-standard folder locations. The PC Migration Wizard has been updated to provide even faster migration.\nUpdates in VMware Fusion 4.0.2\nVMware Fusion 4.0.2 addresses an issue starting virtual machines running a forthcoming version of Mac OS X Lion.\nPC Migration Notes\nFor some best practices and troubleshooting information, see \"Migration Assistant: A Guide\" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.\nVMware Fusion Migrate Your PC\nThe Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7.1 Lion.\nThe VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.\nBefore migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.\nIn the Control Panel, click Power Options.\nOn the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.\nBefore migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.\nThe Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.\nIf you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.\nThe simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.\nRight-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.\nSelect the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.\nYou must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.\nIf you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.\nWorkaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nMigrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.\nAfter migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.\nStart the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.\nDownload a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).\nChange the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nTools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe known issues are grouped as follows:\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nGuest Operating Systems\nBootcamp\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nGraphics\nFolders\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nNetwork Configuration\nVirtual Machine Power States\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nLocalization\nRemovable Devices\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nStarting VMware Fusion with the command vmrun does not work for the first time after installation.\nWorkaround: Double-click the VMware Fusion .app file to start VMware Fusion for the first time. You will be prompted for your system password the first time you run VMware Fusion. vmrun can be used to start VMware Fusion after that.\nThe McAfee Antivirus .iso is removed during AutoUpdate of VMware Fusion if no newer version of the .iso is available.\nWorkaround: Download the McAfee Antivirus .iso.\nIf you installed the VMware Fusion April 2011 Beta or the VMware Fusion June 2011 Beta and then installed VMware Fusion 4.0, the VMware Fusion Help might not display when you click context-sensitive help links from the Fusion user interface.\nWorkaround: Clear the cache for the Help files.\nDelete the following files:\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\nEmpty the Trash.\nRestart VMware Fusion.\nIt might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.\nGuest Operating Systems\nWhen upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.\nWorkaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at \"Migrating OD to 10.7\", perform the following steps:\nPress Cmd-Q in the guest and click the \"Shut Down\" button.\nAdd a second processor core to the virtual machine.\nThe guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.\nWhen configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.\nWorkaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.\nBootcamp\nHibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.\nWorkaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\plugins\\vmsvc.\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nWhen Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.\nUsing Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.\nWorkaround: None.\nIf you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.\nWorkaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.\nIf you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.\nWorkaround: None.\nGraphics\nAdding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.\nWorkaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.\nWorkaround: Try any of the following setting changes.\nChange Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).\nChange Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.\nChange the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.\nGraphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.\nWorkaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.\nIn Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.\nGraphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nSome older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.\nWorkaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.\nSome applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.\nFolders\nIf a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.\nWorkaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.\nIn a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. \nWorkaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nThe application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.\nWorkaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.\nIn Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.\nWorkaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.\nSwitching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.\nWorkaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.\nIf you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.\nWorkaround: None.\nVirtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.\nWorkaround: None.\nHiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.\nWorkaround: None.\nNetwork Configuration\nIn a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.\nWorkaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.\nOn a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.\nWorkaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.\nVirtual Machine Power States\nIf you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nIf CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.\nWorkaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.\nYou can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.\nWorkaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.\nLocalization\nThe VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.\nWorkaround:\nRemove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:\ncom.apple.help.plist\ncom.apple.helpui.plist\ncom.apple.helpviewer.plist\nRemove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:\ncom.apple.helpui folder\ncom.apple.helpdata\nEmpty the Trash.\nReboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.\nRemovable Devices\nIf you change the default system sound output device while VMware Fusion is running, any virtual machines started or resumed after that point use the previous default sound device. Changing the default sound output device while a virtual machine is running will switch to that sound device only until the virtual machine is shut down or suspended.\nWorkaround: Restart VMware Fusion after changing the default sound output device.\nEuropean keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences.

{"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ReleaseContents":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.\nThese release notes include the following topics.\nInstallation Notes\nWhat's New\nUpdates in VMware Fusion 4.0.1\nPC Migration Notes\nKnown Issues\nInstallation Notes\nThe hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0. This version of VMware Fusion requires a 64-bit CPU. Macs containing Intel Core Solo and Core Duo processors are no longer supported. Mac OS X 10.6.7 or higher is required to use VMware Fusion. See the system requirements in Getting Started with VMware Fusion for more details.\nInstall VMware Fusion 4 by dragging the VMware Fusion application icon to a folder on your Mac. The VMware Fusion application can be dragged to the Applications folder or to another location on your Mac. If you are running a previous version of VMware Fusion, double-click the Upgrade icon instead of dragging the application icon.\nVMware Tools Installation\nIn order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion \"light\" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.\nIf you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).\nMcAfee VirusScan for Mac\nIf you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.\nTo prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.\nOn your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.\nClick Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.\nClick More Options.\nSelect Click lock to make changes.\nSelect Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.\nSelect the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.\nLock your changes and close the window.\nThe virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.\nTop of Page\nWhat's New\nThis release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features.\nNew Installation Experience\nNew User Interface\nDesigned for Lion\nVirtual Hardware Improvements\nEncrypted Virtual Machines\nPause State for Virtual Machines\nRemote CD and DVD Drives\nShrinking Disks with Snapshots\nMirrored Folders\nOVF Support\nOther Technical Changes\nNew Installation Experience\nVMware Fusion is now installed by dragging and dropping to the Applications folder. Users of older versions can upgrade using the included utility. VMware Fusion can be uninstalled by quitting the application and dragging it to the trash.\nNew User Interface\nVMware Fusion includes a new user interface designed to maximize screen space dedicated to running virtual machines. By keeping the interface minimal, we have improved user productivity for Windows applications. It is now more consistent with the overall Mac desktop experience than previous versions of VMware Fusion.\nThe new user interface includes the following key features.\nThe Single-window experience is optimized around each running virtual machine, keeping related options and settings together. A new collapsible toolbar provides quick access to common virtual machine actions including switching networks, connecting and disconnecting devices, and sharing options. The Control-Alt-Delete key combination is now available as a menu button.\nThe Virtual Machine Library Welcome screen has been refreshed to make it easier to get up and running quickly.\nThe Virtual Machine Library is updated with thumbnails of virtual machine desktops and shortcuts to common activities.\nThe Settings have been redesigned to make it easier to perform common tasks. New settings subsections for Compatibility, Default Applications and Startup Disk are included.\nThe Snapshot viewer provides powerful new features for working with snapshots using a timeline-based view, inspired by Time Machine.\nDesigned for Lion\nVMware Fusion 4 is designed for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and includes support for using Mission Control to switch between Mac and Windows applications. Support for Spaces and Exposé has also been improved to make it easier to switch between applications.\nMac OS X Lion and Mac OS X Lion Server are now supported as guest operating systems. Mac OS X Lion can be installed by dragging the Lion installer icon to the virtual machine wizard.\nVirtual Hardware Improvements\nAs always, VMware continues to improve our virtual hardware performance and capabilities. You must upgrade the hardware version of your existing VMs or create a new VM in order to get the best features and performance from your virtual machines. Upgrade the hardware version of your virtual machine from the new virtual machine settings page under Compatibility.\nAn HD Audio device is available for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and OS X 10.7 guests. The new HD Audio device takes advantage of the latest sound drivers and produces high sound quality even under heavy load.\nBluetooth devices on the host can now be shared with Windows and Mac OS X guests. Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth phone, are paired to either the host system or to a virtual machine. VMware does not recommend pairing Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones, or Bluetooth input devices, such as keyboards and mice to a guest.\nLink-state propagation enables applications to seamlessly communicate when using NAT-based networking even when moving between networks. For example, communication between applications will continue seamlessly when you move from a wired network to a wireless network.\nOur graphics team continues to improve rendering correctness and to tune our graphics drivers. VMware Fusion 4 is up to 2.5 times faster than VMware Fusion 3 for some 3D operations. Improved support for AutoCAD, SolidWorks and Altium Designer on Windows XP and Windows 7 is also included.\nEncrypted Virtual Machines\nVMware Fusion now enables security best practices by providing virtual disk encryption using industry-standard AES-128. Encryption can require a per-virtual-machine password whenever the virtual machine is powered on.\nPause State for Virtual Machines\nThe new Pause state suspends the virtual machine while retaining the in-memory state. This state can be useful when system resources will temporarily be taxed and the guest virtual machine is not immediately needed.\nRemote CD and DVD Drives\nRemote CD and DVD drives shared from another Windows PC or Mac are supported for installing operating systems on virtual machines.\nShrinking Disks with Snapshots\nVMware Fusion now supports shrinking virtual disks without the need to remove the snapshots first. Shrinking virtual disks without removing snapshots allows users to maintain their virtual machines and reclaim disk space more easily than in previous releases of VMware Fusion. Look for the new virtual machine clean up capability under the General section of the virtual machine settings.\nMirrored Folders\nDownloads and Movies folders are now mirrored from the Mac.\nOVF Support\nSupport for creating OVF-format virtual machines is provided by the standalone OVF tool. This tool is available for download from: http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/server/vsphere/automationtools/ovf?view=overview\nOther Technical Changes\nVMware Fusion 4 is now 64-bit throughout. In addition, services and kernel extensions are loaded and unloaded on-demand. The application can now be run from non-standard folder locations. The PC Migration Wizard has been updated to provide even faster migration.\nUpdates in VMware Fusion 4.0.1\nVMware Fusion 4.0.1 contains an update that ensures that disk buffering is enabled when set to automatic.\nPC Migration Notes\nFor some best practices and troubleshooting information, see \"Migration Assistant: A Guide\" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.\nVMware Fusion Migrate Your PC\nThe Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7.1 Lion.\nThe VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.\nBefore migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.\nIn the Control Panel, click Power Options.\nOn the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.\nBefore migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.\nThe Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.\nIf you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.\nThe simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.\nRight-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.\nSelect the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.\nYou must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.\nIf you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.\nWorkaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nMigrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.\nAfter migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.\nStart the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.\nDownload a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).\nChange the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nTools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe known issues are grouped as follows:\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nGuest Operating Systems\nBootcamp\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nGraphics\nFolders\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nNetwork Configuration\nVirtual Machine Power States\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nLocalization\nRemovable Devices\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nStarting VMware Fusion with the command vmrun does not work for the first time after installation.\nWorkaround: Double-click the VMware Fusion .app file to start VMware Fusion for the first time. You will be prompted for your system password the first time you run VMware Fusion. vmrun can be used to start VMware Fusion after that.\nThe McAfee Antivirus .iso is removed during AutoUpdate of VMware Fusion if no newer version of the .iso is available.\nWorkaround: Download the McAfee Antivirus .iso.\nIf you installed the VMware Fusion April 2011 Beta or the VMware Fusion June 2011 Beta and then installed VMware Fusion 4.0, the VMware Fusion Help might not display when you click context-sensitive help links from the Fusion user interface.\nWorkaround: Clear the cache for the Help files.\nDelete the following files:\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\nEmpty the Trash.\nRestart VMware Fusion.\nIt might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.\nGuest Operating Systems\nWhen upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.\nWorkaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at \"Migrating OD to 10.7\", perform the following steps:\nPress Cmd-Q in the guest and click the \"Shut Down\" button.\nAdd a second processor core to the virtual machine.\nThe guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.\nWhen configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.\nWorkaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.\nBootcamp\nHibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.\nWorkaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\plugins\\vmsvc.\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nWhen Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.\nUsing Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.\nWorkaround: None.\nIf you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.\nWorkaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.\nIf you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.\nWorkaround: None.\nGraphics\nAdding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.\nWorkaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.\nWorkaround: Try any of the following setting changes.\nChange Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).\nChange Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.\nChange the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.\nGraphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.\nWorkaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.\nIn Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.\nGraphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nSome older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.\nWorkaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.\nSome applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.\nFolders\nIf a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.\nWorkaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.\nIn a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. \nWorkaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nThe application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.\nWorkaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.\nIn Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.\nWorkaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.\nSwitching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.\nWorkaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.\nIf you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.\nWorkaround: None.\nVirtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.\nWorkaround: None.\nHiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.\nWorkaround: None.\nNetwork Configuration\nIn a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.\nWorkaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.\nOn a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.\nWorkaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.\nVirtual Machine Power States\nIf you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nIf CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.\nWorkaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.\nYou can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.\nWorkaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.\nLocalization\nThe VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.\nWorkaround:\nRemove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:\ncom.apple.help.plist\ncom.apple.helpui.plist\ncom.apple.helpviewer.plist\nRemove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:\ncom.apple.helpui folder\ncom.apple.helpdata\nEmpty the Trash.\nReboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.\nRemovable Devices\nIf you change the default system sound output device while VMware Fusion is running, any virtual machines started or resumed after that point use the previous default sound device. Changing the default sound output device while a virtual machine is running will switch to that sound device only until the virtual machine is shut down or suspended.\nWorkaround: Restart VMware Fusion after changing the default sound output device.\nEuropean keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences. Sending keys such as @, {, }, and others to Windows does not work as it does on the Mac.\nWorkaround: Only German and French keyboards are supported.\nIf you use a USB headset connected from the host to the guest, you will hear some glitches.\nWorkaround: None.\nPrinting multiple copies of a document from the guest on a USB printer that is connected to the host does not work. If you attempt to print multiple copies from a guest on a USB printer, only one copy is printed.\nWorkaround: Connect the USB printer to the guest directly. Alternatively, connect the printer to the host using network mode. \n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes."},{"entry":"These release notes include the following topics.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes include the following topics."},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Updates in VMware Fusion 4.0.1","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Updates in VMware Fusion 4.0.1"},{"entry":"PC Migration Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"PC Migration Notes"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"The hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0.

{"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ReleaseContents":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.\nThese release notes include the following topics.\nInstallation Notes\nWhat's New\nPC Migration Notes\nKnown Issues\nInstallation Notes\nThe hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0. This version of VMware Fusion requires a 64-bit CPU. Macs containing Intel Core Solo and Core Duo processors are no longer supported. Mac OS X 10.6.7 or higher is required to use VMware Fusion. See the system requirements in Getting Started with VMware Fusion for more details.\nInstall VMware Fusion 4 by dragging the VMware Fusion application icon to a folder on your Mac. The VMware Fusion application can be dragged to the Applications folder or to another location on your Mac. If you are running a previous version of VMware Fusion, double-click the Upgrade icon instead of dragging the application icon.\nVMware Tools Installation\nIn order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion \"light\" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.\nIf you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).\nMcAfee VirusScan for Mac\nIf you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.\nTo prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.\nOn your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.\nClick Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.\nClick More Options.\nSelect Click lock to make changes.\nSelect Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.\nSelect the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.\nLock your changes and close the window.\nThe virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.\nTop of Page\nWhat's New\nThis release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features.\nNew Installation Experience\nNew User Interface\nDesigned for Lion\nVirtual Hardware Improvements\nEncrypted Virtual Machines\nPause State for Virtual Machines\nRemote CD and DVD Drives\nShrinking Disks with Snapshots\nMirrored Folders\nOVF Support\nOther Technical Changes\nNew Installation Experience\nVMware Fusion is now installed by dragging and dropping to the Applications folder. Users of older versions can upgrade using the included utility. VMware Fusion can be uninstalled by quitting the application and dragging it to the trash.\nNew User Interface\nVMware Fusion includes a new user interface designed to maximize screen space dedicated to running virtual machines. By keeping the interface minimal, we have improved user productivity for Windows applications. It is now more consistent with the overall Mac desktop experience than previous versions of VMware Fusion.\nThe new user interface includes the following key features.\nThe Single-window experience is optimized around each running virtual machine, keeping related options and settings together. A new collapsible toolbar provides quick access to common virtual machine actions including switching networks, connecting and disconnecting devices, and sharing options. The Control-Alt-Delete key combination is now available as a menu button.\nThe Virtual Machine Library Welcome screen has been refreshed to make it easier to get up and running quickly.\nThe Virtual Machine Library is updated with thumbnails of virtual machine desktops and shortcuts to common activities.\nThe Settings have been redesigned to make it easier to perform common tasks. New settings subsections for Compatibility, Default Applications and Startup Disk are included.\nThe Snapshot viewer provides powerful new features for working with snapshots using a timeline-based view, inspired by Time Machine.\nDesigned for Lion\nVMware Fusion 4 is designed for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and includes support for using Mission Control to switch between Mac and Windows applications. Support for Spaces and Exposé has also been improved to make it easier to switch between applications.\nMac OS X Lion and Mac OS X Lion Server are now supported as guest operating systems. Mac OS X Lion can be installed by dragging the Lion installer icon to the virtual machine wizard.\nVirtual Hardware Improvements\nAs always, VMware continues to improve our virtual hardware performance and capabilities. You must upgrade the hardware version of your existing VMs or create a new VM in order to get the best features and performance from your virtual machines. Upgrade the hardware version of your virtual machine from the new virtual machine settings page under Compatibility.\nAn HD Audio device is available for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and OS X 10.7 guests. The new HD Audio device takes advantage of the latest sound drivers and produces high sound quality even under heavy load.\nBluetooth devices on the host can now be shared with Windows and Mac OS X guests. Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth phone, are paired to either the host system or to a virtual machine. VMware does not recommend pairing Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones, or Bluetooth input devices, such as keyboards and mice to a guest.\nLink-state propagation enables applications to seamlessly communicate when using NAT-based networking even when moving between networks. For example, communication between applications will continue seamlessly when you move from a wired network to a wireless network.\nOur graphics team continues to improve rendering correctness and to tune our graphics drivers. VMware Fusion 4 is up to 2.5 times faster than VMware Fusion 3 for some 3D operations. Improved support for AutoCAD, SolidWorks and Altium Designer on Windows XP and Windows 7 is also included.\nEncrypted Virtual Machines\nVMware Fusion now enables security best practices by providing virtual disk encryption using industry-standard AES-128. Encryption can require a per-virtual-machine password whenever the virtual machine is powered on.\nPause State for Virtual Machines\nThe new Pause state suspends the virtual machine while retaining the in-memory state. This state can be useful when system resources will temporarily be taxed and the guest virtual machine is not immediately needed.\nRemote CD and DVD Drives\nRemote CD and DVD drives shared from another Windows PC or Mac are supported for installing operating systems on virtual machines.\nShrinking Disks with Snapshots\nVMware Fusion now supports shrinking virtual disks without the need to remove the snapshots first. Shrinking virtual disks without removing snapshots allows users to maintain their virtual machines and reclaim disk space more easily than in previous releases of VMware Fusion. Look for the new virtual machine clean up capability under the General section of the virtual machine settings.\nMirrored Folders\nDownloads and Movies folders are now mirrored from the Mac.\nOVF Support\nSupport for creating OVF-format virtual machines is provided by the standalone OVF tool. This tool is available for download from: http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/server/vsphere/automationtools/ovf?view=overview\nOther Technical Changes\nVMware Fusion 4 is now 64-bit throughout. In addition, services and kernel extensions are loaded and unloaded on-demand. The application can now be run from non-standard folder locations. The PC Migration Wizard has been updated to provide even faster migration.\nPC Migration Notes\nFor some best practices and troubleshooting information, see \"Migration Assistant: A Guide\" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.\nVMware Fusion Migrate Your PC\nThe Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7.1 Lion.\nThe VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.\nBefore migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.\nIn the Control Panel, click Power Options.\nOn the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.\nBefore migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.\nThe Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.\nIf you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.\nThe simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.\nRight-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.\nSelect the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.\nYou must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.\nIf you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.\nWorkaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nMigrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.\nAfter migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.\nStart the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.\nDownload a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).\nChange the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nTools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe known issues are grouped as follows:\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nGuest Operating Systems\nBootcamp\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nGraphics\nFolders\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nNetwork Configuration\nVirtual Machine Power States\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nLocalization\nRemovable Devices\nVMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade\nStarting VMware Fusion with the command vmrun does not work for the first time after installation.\nWorkaround: Double-click the VMware Fusion .app file to start VMware Fusion for the first time. You will be prompted for your system password the first time you run VMware Fusion. vmrun can be used to start VMware Fusion after that.\nThe McAfee Antivirus .iso is removed during AutoUpdate of VMware Fusion if no newer version of the .iso is available.\nWorkaround: Download the McAfee Antivirus .iso.\nIf you installed the VMware Fusion April 2011 Beta or the VMware Fusion June 2011 Beta and then installed VMware Fusion 4.0, the VMware Fusion Help might not display when you click context-sensitive help links from the Fusion user interface.\nWorkaround: Clear the cache for the Help files.\nDelete the following files:\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\n$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*\nEmpty the Trash.\nRestart VMware Fusion.\nIt might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.\nGuest Operating Systems\nWhen upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.\nWorkaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at \"Migrating OD to 10.7\", perform the following steps:\nPress Cmd-Q in the guest and click the \"Shut Down\" button.\nAdd a second processor core to the virtual machine.\nThe guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.\nWhen configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.\nWorkaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.\nBootcamp\nHibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.\nWorkaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\plugins\\vmsvc.\nAccessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder\nWhen Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.\nUsing Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.\nWorkaround: None.\nIf you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.\nWorkaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.\nIf you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.\nWorkaround: None.\nGraphics\nAdding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.\nWorkaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.\nWorkaround: Try any of the following setting changes.\nChange Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).\nChange Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.\nChange the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.\nGraphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.\nWorkaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.\nIn Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.\nGraphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nSome older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.\nWorkaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.\nSome applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.\nWorkaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.\nFolders\nIf a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.\nWorkaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.\nIn a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. \nWorkaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.\nVirtual Machine View Modes\nThe application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.\nWorkaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.\nIn Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.\nWorkaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.\nSwitching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.\nWorkaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.\nIf you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.\nWorkaround: None.\nVirtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.\nWorkaround: None.\nHiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.\nWorkaround: None.\nNetwork Configuration\nIn a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.\nWorkaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.\nOn a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.\nWorkaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.\nVirtual Machine Power States\nIf you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.\nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Fusion User Interface\nIf CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.\nWorkaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.\nYou can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.\nWorkaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.\nLocalization\nThe VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.\nWorkaround:\nRemove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:\ncom.apple.help.plist\ncom.apple.helpui.plist\ncom.apple.helpviewer.plist\nRemove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:\ncom.apple.helpui folder\ncom.apple.helpdata\nEmpty the Trash.\nReboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.\nRemovable Devices\nIf you change the default system sound output device while VMware Fusion is running, any virtual machines started or resumed after that point use the previous default sound device. Changing the default sound output device while a virtual machine is running will switch to that sound device only until the virtual machine is shut down or suspended.\nWorkaround: Restart VMware Fusion after changing the default sound output device.\nEuropean keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences. Sending keys such as @, {, }, and others to Windows does not work as it does on the Mac.\nWorkaround: Only German and French keyboards are supported.\nIf you use a USB headset connected from the host to the guest, you will hear some glitches.\nWorkaround: None.\nPrinting multiple copies of a document from the guest on a USB printer that is connected to the host does not work. If you attempt to print multiple copies from a guest on a USB printer, only one copy is printed.\nWorkaround: Connect the USB printer to the guest directly. Alternatively, connect the printer to the host using network mode. \n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Check frequently for additions and updates to these release notes."},{"entry":"These release notes include the following topics.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes include the following topics."},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"PC Migration Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"PC Migration Notes"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.0","ReleaseDate":"14/09/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"The hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0.

In addition, the release notes contain information on system requirements and installation. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 3.1, click the following links:\nVMware Fusion 3.1.2\nVMware Fusion 3.1.1\nVMware Fusion 3.1\nResolved Issues\nThis release resolves the following issues:\nThe Samsung Galaxy S phone with Android 2.1 is not recognized in an OS X host or in a Windows 7 guest.\nPreviously, to use a Logitech HD Webcam C510 in a Windows 7 virtual machine, you had to include the quirks line (Usb.quirks.device0 = \"0x046d:0x081d skip-reset\") as a configuration option in the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file. Now, you no longer need to include the quirks line in the .vmx file.\nWhen you connect a Nokia N8 phone to a Windows XP guest and attempt to connect to it by using the Nokia Ovi Suite, the phone does not stay connected to the guest. The Windows Device Manager in the Windows XP guest reports This device cannot start. (Code 10).\nYou cannot connect USB 2.0 devices to FreeBSD guests.\nWhen you use Suspend Guest and Resume Guest to suspend and resume an Ubuntu 10.10 guest, the network interface is down after the guest is resumed.\nWhen you run an Nmap (\"Network Mapper\") scan from a virtual machine that is configured to use Network Address Translation (NAT) networking to an external Windows machine, the NAT service fails and the virtual machine has problems connecting to the external network.\nYou cannot use Microsoft Office 2010 in a Windows guest to open an attachment in a shared folder. The guest returns an error message that states the file is not located in a shared folder and cannot be opened by the host.\nA Mac OS X Server 10.6.x virtual machine is unable to access IDE hard disks and CD/DVD drives after the guest is updated to 10.6.5 or newer. If the boot volume is on an IDE hard disk, the guest will fail to boot.\nAfter a Windows 7 guest goes into screen saver mode, you cannot wake up the guest when you click inside the virtual machine. This problem occurs only when the following screen saver and power plan settings are selected or enabled:\nIn Screen Saver Settings, a screen saver is enabled, the idle time is set, and \"On resume, display logon screen\" is selected.\nIn Power Options, the Balanced plan is selected and the \"Turn off the display\" and \"Put the computer to sleep\" plan settings are set to the same timeout value as the screen saver idle time.\nPreviously, when you created a Mac OS X virtual machine in Fusion, the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file contained an absolute path to the virtual machine disk (.vmdk) file. This setting prevented you from copying the virtual machine because the copy pointed to the .vmdk file for the original virtual machine. Now, the .vmx file contains a relative path to the .vmdk file and you can copy Mac OS X virtual machines.\nWhen DisplayLink drivers are installed in a Windows 7 virtual machine, the virtual machine crashes when you run it in Fusion.\nPreviously, when a virtual machine was configured to use NAT networking, browser performance was slow the first time you launched Internet Explorer 7 or 8 after starting the virtual machine for the first time and after resuming the virtual machine. Now, browser performance has been improved.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion\nThe known issues for VMware Fusion are grouped by topic in the following sections.\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nUser Interface Issues\nGuest Operating System Issues\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nApplication Issues\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nPC Migration Issues\nDevice Issues\nMiscellaneous Issues\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nIf you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.\nIf you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.\nThe default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and AutoProtect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.\nWorkaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.\nDelete all snapshots for the virtual machine:\nSelect Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.\n(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.\nClick the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.\nClick Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.\nRebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:\nPower off the virtual machine.\nClick the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.\nUnder Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.\nDeselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.\nVMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.\nYou might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.\nAfter you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. \nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.\nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nA virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.\nVMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.\nInstallation can stall with the message, Please insert the \"<username>\" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.\nIf you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:\nInstall from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).\nInstall using a different user account that does not use FileVault.\nEasy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.\nWhen you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.\nYou must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.\nFor VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. \nHaving a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.\nBefore installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. \nIf you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.\nYou can remove those packages by running the following command as root\n$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default\nOr you can use the Software Management application in YaST:\nOpen YaST.\nClick on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).\nFind and click Software Management.\nRemove the packages.\nUser Interface Issues\nUnity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.\nWhen a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.\nIn some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.\nThis can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.\nWorkaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.\nOn MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.\nIn this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, \"A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers.\"\nTo work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nSelect Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.\nSelect Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.\nWith Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.\nIf you use command+d or control+option+d (\"show desktop\") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.\nCannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.\nThis problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.\nWhen you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.\nAero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.\nVirtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.\nWhen you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.\nWhile running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.\nThis occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.\nPutting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.\nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nKeyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.\nIf you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.\nThe size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.\nBecause of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.\nQuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.\nOccasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.\nDisable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nHaving a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.\n3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: \"DirectX error message . . .\"\nIf the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.\nEditing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.\nVMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.\nGuest Operating System Issues\nDo not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.\nUsing fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.\nThe universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. \nThese physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.\nWorkaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine and use a combo updater to update directly to 10.6.4 or 10.6.5 (the latest version at time of writing).\nInstall GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. \nVMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, \"Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error\".\nOn SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.\nWorkaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.\nFrom the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.\nTo turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.\nIf you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.\nIf you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.\nSome dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.\nTo delete old dockers, take the following steps.\nSuspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.\nOpen the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.\nClose the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.\nNew dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.\nIn certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.\nOccasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.\nIn some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.\nIf you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:\nsvga.vramSize = \"33554432\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the virtual machine again.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nInstall Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.\nInstall Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nDo not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.\nIf you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.\nWorkaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.\nIf you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.\nIn a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.\nShared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.\nYou can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.\nWorkaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.\nVMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.\nIf you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.\nOld .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.\nWith VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\\\.host\\Shared Folders to \\\\vmware-host\\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.\nDefault applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.\nSetting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.\nIf a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.\nIf you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.\nSometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. \nThere are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating \"file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest.\" VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.\nWorking offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.\nUsing mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.\nWorkaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.\nThe Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.\nIn some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.\nDefault browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.\nIn certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.\nApplication Issues\nAudio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.\nPlayback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.\nSome 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.\nRunning certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.\nWorkaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.\n3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.\nIf you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.\nSelect Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.\nDeselect 3D.\nInternet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. \nIf you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, \"Protected Mode\" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\\\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.\nWorkaround:\nOpen Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.\nClick the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).\nClick Sites, then Advanced, type \\\\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.\nBack in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.\nClick OK, and accept the warning, \"The current security settings will put your computer at risk,\" by clicking OK again.\nClose Internet Explorer to apply the change.\nInternet Explorer will now open files from \\\\vmware-host correctly.\nSome games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.\nParts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.\nAfter quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.\nGalactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.\nThis problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.\nRunning certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.\nGames known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.\nRunning the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.\nOn a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nVMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.\nWhen you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.\nWhile importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).\nWorkaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nVMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.\nIf you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. \nTo work around this problem\nQuit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp\nDelete Boot Camp\nRestart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition\nFlat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.\nVMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.\nReconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.\nSome virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time.\" If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.\nUsing the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.\nIf this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nPC Migration Issues\nVMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.\nIf you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:\nInsufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)\nWorkaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.\nIf you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.\nIf the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.\nBecause of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.\nDo not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.\nFor instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, \"Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine.\"\nSound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.\nIf you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.\nWorkaround: Add a sound device.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nChoose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.\nIn the Removable Devices section, select Sound.\nClick Add Sound Device and close the window.\nPower on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.\nDevice Issues\nNEW An error occurs when you connect a Globetrotter Connect iCON 225 USB device to the host.\nWorkaround: Update the host operating system to Mac OS 10.6.6.\nIf you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.\nConnecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.\nOn Mac OS X 10.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.\nUpgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 or later fixes this issue.\nIf you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.\nIf you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, \"The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size.\" However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.\nWorkaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.\nIf you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.\nHaving iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, \"iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes\". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: \"The iPad \"name\" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602).\"\nIf you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.\nAttempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.\nMounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.\nBuggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.\nOn Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.\nEnabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.\nSelecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.\nYou cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.\nIf you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.\nVMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.\nVMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.\nTo add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.\nIf you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.\nMiscellaneous Issues\nOVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.\nIf OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.\nWorkaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: \"$OVFTOOL_BIN\" \"$@\"\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.3","ReleaseDate":"31/05/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.3","ReleaseDate":"31/05/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.3","ReleaseDate":"31/05/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.3","ReleaseDate":"31/05/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.3","ReleaseDate":"31/05/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.3","ReleaseDate":"31/05/2011","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 3.1.3 is a maintenance release that resolves some known issues and includes improved functionality.

It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 3.x users.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 3\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion are described in the release notes for each release, along with existing known issues. In addition, the release notes contain information on system requirements and installation. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 3.1, click the following links:\nVMware Fusion 3.1.1\nVMware Fusion 3.1\nResolved Issues\nThis release resolves the following issues:\nThe error Could not publish or run one or more applications. occurs when resuming a virtual machine that has DivX Player installed in the guest.\nSlingbox Slingplayer does not display video in the guest when 3D acceleration is enabled. In addition, very high CPU usage occurs if the guest is set to 1 core.\nMicrosoft Office applications do not display as the frontmost window when they are launched in Unity view.\nSound volume in the guest operating system is reduced after upgrading to Fusion 3.1. The volume observed through the host is not consistent with the guest volume setting.\nIn a Windows XP guest, if you connect a handheld device to the host, the handshake application might time out or stop responding due to unhandled USB disable requests.\nWhile the virtual machine is running, if you switch from full screen mode to single window mode, the virtual machine window disappears and the light underneath the Fusion icon disappears as well. Fusion stops responding if you restart after this issue occurs.\nThe guest operating system might fail with a blue screen and the error Multiple IRP Complete Requests if you access a file or folder two or more folders deep into a VMware Shared Folder and are running applications, such as Microsoft Office Powerpoint or Project, that use the byte range locks file system feature.\nSamsung Galaxy S phone with Android 2.1 does not work with Fusion. The phone does not appear in the virtual machine.\nGuest software might use CPUID information to determine characteristics of underlying (virtual or physical) CPU hardware. In some instances, CPUID information returned by virtual hardware will differ from the responses physical hardware might report. Based on these differences, certain pieces of guest software might not behave as expected. In this release, this fix causes certain CPUID responses to more closely match the responses that physical hardware might return.\nIf you run Outlook 2007 in Unity mode, the Outlook dock icon might flash, or briefly quit and restart. When this happens the Outlook window also disappears and then reappears.\nMac OS X Server guests might intermittently fail to boot, displaying a stop symbol on a gray screen shortly after powering on.\nAdditionally, this release resolves the following security-related issues:\nThe way temporary files are handled by the mounting process could result in a race condition. This issue could allow a local user on the host to elevate their privileges. Windows-based host systems are not affected.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4295 to this issue.\nvmware-mount, which is a SUID binary, has a flaw in the way libraries are loaded. This issue could allow local users on the host to execute arbitrary shared object files with root privileges. Windows-based host systems are not affected.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4296 to this issue.\nA vulnerability in the input validation of VMware Tools update allows for injection of commands. This issue could allow a user on the host to execute commands on the guest operating system with root privileges. The issue can only be exploited if VMware Tools is not fully up-to-date. Windows-based virtual machines are not affected. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4297 to this issue.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion\nThe known issues for VMware Fusion are grouped by topic in the following sections.\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nUser Interface Issues\nGuest Operating System Issues\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nApplication Issues\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nPC Migration Issues\nDevice Issues\nMiscellaneous Issues\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nIf you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.\nIf you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.\nThe default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and AutoProtect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.\nWorkaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.\nDelete all snapshots for the virtual machine:\nSelect Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.\n(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.\nClick the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.\nClick Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.\nRebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:\nPower off the virtual machine.\nClick the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.\nUnder Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.\nDeselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.\nVMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.\nYou might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.\nAfter you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. \nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.\nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nA virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.\nVMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.\nInstallation can stall with the message, Please insert the \"<username>\" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.\nIf you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:\nInstall from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).\nInstall using a different user account that does not use FileVault.\nEasy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.\nWhen you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.\nYou must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.\nFor VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. \nHaving a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.\nBefore installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. \nIf you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.\nYou can remove those packages by running the following command as root\n$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default\nOr you can use the Software Management application in YaST:\nOpen YaST.\nClick on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).\nFind and click Software Management.\nRemove the packages.\nUser Interface Issues\nUnity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.\nWhen a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.\nIn some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.\nThis can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.\nWorkaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.\nOn MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.\nIn this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, \"A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers.\"\nTo work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nSelect Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.\nSelect Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.\nWith Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.\nIf you use command+d or control+option+d (\"show desktop\") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.\nCannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.\nThis problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.\nWhen you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.\nAero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.\nVirtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.\nWhen you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.\nWhile running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.\nThis occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.\nPutting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.\nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nKeyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.\nIf you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.\nThe size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.\nBecause of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.\nQuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.\nOccasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.\nDisable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nHaving a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.\n3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: \"DirectX error message . . .\"\nIf the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.\nEditing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.\nVMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.\nGuest Operating System Issues\nDo not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.\nUsing fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.\nThe universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. \nThese physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.\nWorkaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine and use a combo updater to update directly to 10.6.4 or 10.6.5 (the latest version at time of writing).\nInstall GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. \nVMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, \"Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error\".\nOn SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.\nWorkaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.\nFrom the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.\nTo turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.\nIf you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.\nIf you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.\nSome dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.\nTo delete old dockers, take the following steps.\nSuspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.\nOpen the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.\nClose the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.\nNew dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.\nIn certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.\nOccasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.\nIn some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.\nIf you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:\nsvga.vramSize = \"33554432\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the virtual machine again.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nInstall Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.\nInstall Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nDo not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.\nIf you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.\nWorkaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.\nIf you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.\nIn a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.\nShared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.\nYou can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.\nWorkaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.\nVMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.\nIf you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.\nOld .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.\nWith VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\\\.host\\Shared Folders to \\\\vmware-host\\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.\nDefault applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.\nSetting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.\nIf a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.\nIf you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.\nSometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. \nThere are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating \"file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest.\" VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.\nWorking offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.\nUsing mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.\nWorkaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.\nThe Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.\nIn some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.\nDefault browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.\nIn certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.\nApplication Issues\nAudio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.\nPlayback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.\nSome 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.\nRunning certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.\nWorkaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.\n3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.\nIf you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.\nSelect Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.\nDeselect 3D.\nInternet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. \nIf you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, \"Protected Mode\" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\\\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.\nWorkaround:\nOpen Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.\nClick the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).\nClick Sites, then Advanced, type \\\\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.\nBack in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.\nClick OK, and accept the warning, \"The current security settings will put your computer at risk,\" by clicking OK again.\nClose Internet Explorer to apply the change.\nInternet Explorer will now open files from \\\\vmware-host correctly.\nSome games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.\nParts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.\nAfter quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.\nGalactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.\nThis problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.\nRunning certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.\nGames known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.\nRunning the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.\nOn a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nVMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.\nWhen you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.\nWhile importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).\nWorkaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nVMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.\nIf you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. \nTo work around this problem\nQuit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp\nDelete Boot Camp\nRestart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition\nFlat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.\nVMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.\nReconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.\nSome virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time.\" If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.\nUsing the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.\nIf this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nPC Migration Issues\nVMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.\nIf you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:\nInsufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)\nWorkaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.\nIf you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.\nIf the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.\nBecause of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.\nDo not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.\nFor instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, \"Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine.\"\nSound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.\nIf you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.\nWorkaround: Add a sound device.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nChoose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.\nIn the Removable Devices section, select Sound.\nClick Add Sound Device and close the window.\nPower on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.\nDevice Issues\nIf you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.\nConnecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.\nOn Mac OS X 10.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.\nUpgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 or later fixes this issue.\nIf you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.\nIf you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, \"The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size.\" However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.\nWorkaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.\nIf you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.\nHaving iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, \"iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes\". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: \"The iPad \"name\" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602).\"\nIf you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.\nAttempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.\nMounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.\nBuggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.\nOn Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.\nEnabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.\nSelecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.\nYou cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.\nIf you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.\nVMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.\nVMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.\nTo add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.\nIf you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.\nMiscellaneous Issues\nOVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.\nIf OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.\nWorkaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: \"$OVFTOOL_BIN\" \"$@\"\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.2","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.2","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.2","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.2","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.2","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.2","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 3.1.2 is a maintenance release that resolves some known issues.

{"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 3\nKnown Issues\nResolved Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion 3.1.1 is a maintenance release that resolves the following issues and adds new support. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 3.x users.\nVMware vSphere 4.1 is now supported as a guest operating system. VMware Certified Professionals (VCPs) and virtualization experts can use VMware vSphere 4.1 to install the latest server virtualization software and experiment with server setup, conduct training, show demos, and test production configurations. Running ESX as a guest eliminates the need to have spare hardware available to run ESX natively and enables ESX to run on systems that are not listed on the ESX hardware compatibility list (HCL). For more information on the supported processors and host operating systems, see see Considerations for Running an ESX Guest.\nThis feature is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production environments. To use this feature, you must download vSphere 4.1 from the VMware Web site and follow the installation documentation provided with VMware vSphere to install ESX.\nFor more information on VMware vSphere, see http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/.\nResolves an issue around accessing some iSight cameras.\nResolves an issue where an incorrect disk error message appeared after a host crash occurs while working in a virtual machine.\nResolves an issue where audio recording failed when the recording device output was not 44.1 kHz.\nFor more details, see Resolved Issues.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 3\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion are described in the release notes for each release, along with existing known issues. In addition, the release notes contain information on system requirements and installation. To view release notes for the prior release of VMware Fusion 3.1, see VMware Fusion 3.1.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion\nThe known issues for VMware Fusion are grouped by topic in the following sections.\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nUser Interface Issues\nGuest Operating System Issues\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nApplication Issues\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nPC Migration Issues\nDevice Issues\nMiscellaneous Issues\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nIf you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.\nIf you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.\nThe default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and autoprotect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.\nWorkaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.\nDelete all snapshots for the virtual machine:\nSelect Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.\n(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.\nClick the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.\nClick Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.\nRebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:\nPower off the virtual machine.\nClick the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.\nUnder Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.\nDeselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.\nVMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.\nYou might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.\nAfter you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. \nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.\nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nA virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.\nVMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.\nInstallation can stall with the message, Please insert the \"<username>\" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.\nIf you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:\nInstall from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).\nInstall using a different user account that does not use FileVault.\nEasy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.\nWhen you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.\nYou must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.\nFor VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. \nHaving a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.\nBefore installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. \nIf you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.\nYou can remove those packages by running the following command as root\n$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default\nOr you can use the Software Management application in YaST:\nOpen YaST.\nClick on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).\nFind and click Software Management.\nRemove the packages.\nUser Interface Issues\nUnity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.\nWhen a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.\nIn some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.\nThis can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.\nWorkaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.\nOn MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.\nIn this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, \"A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers.\"\nTo work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nSelect Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.\nSelect Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.\nWith Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.\nIf you use command+d or control+option+d (\"show desktop\") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.\nCannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.\nThis problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.\nWhen you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.\nAero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.\nVirtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.\nWhen you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.\nWhile running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.\nThis occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.\nPutting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.\nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nKeyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.\nIf you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.\nThe size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.\nBecause of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.\nQuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.\nOccasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.\nDisable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nHaving a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.\n3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: \"DirectX error message . . .\"\nIf the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.\nEditing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.\nVMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.\nGuest Operating System Issues\nDo not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.\nUsing fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.\nThe universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. \nThese physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.\nWorkaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine, and do not update the guest operating system until Apple releases 10.6.4.\nInstall GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. \nVMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, \"Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error\".\nOn SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.\nWorkaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.\nFrom the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.\nTo turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.\nIf you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.\nIf you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.\nSome dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.\nTo delete old dockers, take the following steps.\nSuspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.\nOpen the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.\nClose the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.\nNew dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.\nIn certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.\nOccasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.\nIn some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.\nIf you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:\nsvga.vramSize = \"33554432\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the virtual machine again.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nInstall Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.\nInstall Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nDo not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.\nIf you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.\nWorkaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.\nIf you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.\nIn a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.\nShared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.\nYou can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.\nWorkaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.\nVMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.\nIf you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.\nOld .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.\nWith VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\\\.host\\Shared Folders to \\\\vmware-host\\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.\nDefault applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.\nSetting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.\nIf a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.\nIf you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.\nSometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. \nThere are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating \"file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest.\" VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.\nWorking offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.\nUsing mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.\nWorkaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.\nThe Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.\nIn some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.\nDefault browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.\nIn certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.\nApplication Issues\nAudio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.\nPlayback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.\nSome 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.\nRunning certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.\nWorkaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.\n3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.\nIf you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.\nSelect Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.\nDeselect 3D.\nInternet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. \nIf you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, \"Protected Mode\" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\\\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.\nWorkaround:\nOpen Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.\nClick the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).\nClick Sites, then Advanced, type \\\\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.\nBack in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.\nClick OK, and accept the warning, \"The current security settings will put your computer at risk,\" by clicking OK again.\nClose Internet Explorer to apply the change.\nInternet Explorer will now open files from \\\\vmware-host correctly.\nSome games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.\nParts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.\nAfter quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.\nGalactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.\nThis problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.\nRunning certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.\nGames known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.\nRunning the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.\nOn a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nVMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.\nWhen you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.\nWhile importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).\nWorkaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nVMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.\nIf you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. \nTo work around this problem\nQuit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp\nDelete Boot Camp\nRestart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition\nFlat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.\nVMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.\nReconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.\nSome virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time.\" If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.\nUsing the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.\nIf this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nPC Migration Issues\nVMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.\nIf you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:\nInsufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)\nWorkaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.\nIf you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.\nIf the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.\nBecause of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.\nDo not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.\nFor instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, \"Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine.\"\nSound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.\nIf you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.\nWorkaround: Add a sound device.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nChoose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.\nIn the Removable Devices section, select Sound.\nClick Add Sound Device and close the window.\nPower on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.\nDevice Issues\nIf you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.\nConnecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.\nOn Mac OS X 10.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.\nUpgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 fixes this issue.\nIf you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.\nIf you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, \"The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size.\" However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.\nWorkaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.\nIf you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.\nHaving iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, \"iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes\". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: \"The iPad \"name\" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602).\"\nIf you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.\nAttempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.\nMounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.\nBuggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.\nOn Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.\nEnabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.\nSelecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.\nYou cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.\nIf you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.\nVMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.\nVMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.\nTo add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.\nIf you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.\nMiscellaneous Issues\nOVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.\nIf OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.\nWorkaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: \"$OVFTOOL_BIN\" \"$@\"\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThis release resolves the following issues:\nSome iSight video cameras fail to connect to Windows virtual machines. These devices automatically switch device IDs and reset when they detect that they have been moved from Mac OS to a Windows OS, and the reset initiates the USB EasyConnect service which results in the device being connected back to the Mac host.\nMounting a .vmdk on Mac OS X using VMDKMounter might occasionally display the error message VMDKmounter cannot open files in the VMware virtual disk format. This error message displays if the VMDKMounter is prevented from writing its log file. This update release resolves the permissions issue and enables the VMDK files to mount successfully.\nWhen a host system failure occurs during a virtual machine disk operation, attempting to power on the virtual machine or mount the virtual disk using the VMware Disk Mount utility causes the following error messages to appear, \"Cannot open the disk... The specified virtual disk needs repair\" and \"Error reading volume information. Please select another disk file\". There is no data lost during this process. VMware Fusion 3.1.1 fixes these issues and enables virtual machine operations to resume.\nAudio recordings can now be made from devices that output at a sampling rate other than the default rate expected by the host. Typically, the default sampling rate is 44.1 KHz. Audio recordings that are out of sync occasionally play back at a faster rate than expected or would fail to play. This update release matches the sampling rate used by the recording software to the output rate of the physical device and resolves this issue.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.1.1","ReleaseDate":"12/08/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 3.1.1 is a maintenance release that resolves the following issues and adds new support.

To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 3, click the following links:\nVMware Fusion 3.0.2\nVMware Fusion 3.0.1\nVMware Fusion 3.0\nTop of Page\nOther VMware Fusion 3.1 Documentation\nGetting Started with VMware Fusion (PDF)—a compact guide on installing VMware Fusion and creating virtual machines.\nUsing vmrun to Control Virtual Machines (PDF)—a manual for developers and system administrators who want to control virtual machines on various platforms, including VMware Fusion.\nOpen Virtualization Format (OVF) (HTML)—a VMware Web page devoted to OVF, with links to documentation and discussions of the OVF Tool. VMware OVF Tool is a command line utility that supports importing and exporting of OVF packages for a wide variety of VMware platforms, including VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, VMware Server 2.0, vSphere 4.0, and earlier versions of VMware ESX Server and VMware VirtualCenter.\nSystem Requirements for VMware Fusion\nThe minimum system requirements for installing and using VMware Fusion are:\nAny Mac with an Intel processor\n1GB of RAM, 2GB recommended\n700MB of free disk space for VMware Fusion, and at least 5GB of free disk space for each virtual machine\nMac OS X version 10.5.8 or later; Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard or later\nOperating system installation media (disk or disk image) for virtual machines\nNote: You must have enough memory to run Mac OS X, plus the memory required for each guest operating system and for applications on the Mac and in the virtual machine. See your guest operating system and application documentation for their memory requirements.\nSystem Requirements for Aero and Unity View Performance\nThe following list describes the recommended minimum hardware required to provide Windows Vista and Windows 7 Aero functionality in Unity view without performance issues.\nIntel Core Duo 2.2GHz or better CPU\nNVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT, ATI Radeon HD 2600, or better GPU\nGraphics memory 256MB\nHost system memory 2GB\nGuest allocated memory 1GB\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system.\nImportant: VMware Fusion requires Mac OS X 10.5.8 (\"Leopard\") or later. It will not install on Mac OS X 10.4 (\"Tiger\").\nInstalling VMware Fusion 3.1 will overwrite earlier versions of the application.\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time, so if you install VMware Fusion 3.1 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 3.0.x, 2.x or 1.x, the VMware Fusion 3.1 version replaces the earlier version. This change does not affect your virtual machines. \nIf you want to revert to version 3.0.x, 2.x or 1.x, you will need to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nInstallation Notes\nVMware Tools\nIn order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion \"light\" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.\nIf you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).\nMcAfee VirusScan for Mac\nIf you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.\nTo prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.\nOn your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.\nClick Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.\nClick More Options.\nSelect Click lock to make changes.\nSelect Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.\nSelect the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.\nLock your changes and close the window.\nThe virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.\nTop of Page\nPC Migration Notes\nFor some best practices and troubleshooting information, see \"Migration Assistant: A Guide\" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.\nVMware Fusion Migrate Your PC\nThe Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7. You can migrate a PC to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 Leopard and Mac OS X 10.6.3 Snow Leopard.\nThe VMware Fusion Migration Agent installer must be downloaded from the VMware web site and installed on the source PC. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.\nmd5 checksum (VMware-FusionPCMigrationAgent-4.0.7-261056.exe) = deb27dc2b92a63eac7e70f7cd9b3bbd7\nBefore migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.\nIn the Control Panel, click Power Options.\nOn the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.\nBefore migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.\nThe Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.\nIf you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.\nThe simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.\nRight-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.\nSelect the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.\nYou must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.\nIf you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.\nWorkaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nMigrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.\nAfter migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.\nStart the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.\nDownload a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).\nChange the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nTools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.\nManual Tools Reinstall for Migrated Windows Vista and Windows 7\nThe automatic installation of VMware Tools in a migrated virtual machine must be followed by a manual install of Tools for virtual machines with Windows Vista and Windows 7.\nStart the virtual machine. VMware Fusion installs VMware Tools.\nRestart the virtual machine when the automatic tools installation is completed.\nIn the VMware Fusion menu, select Virtual Machine > Upgrade VMware Tools to initiate a manual installation.\nSelect Repair in the Installer that runs in the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine.\nRestart the virtual machine at the end of the manual tools installation.\nTop of Page\nTips and Tricks\nFor tips and tricks on how to use the VMware Fusion interface and for answers to technical questions, see the FAQ: http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/resources/faqs.html.\nThe VMware Fusion documents section of VMware Communities also contains much useful information: http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/desktop/fusion?view=documents.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion 3.1\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nUser Interface Issues\nGuest Operating System Issues\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nApplication Issues\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nPC Migration Issues\nDevice Issues\nMiscellaneous Issues\nVirtual Machine Creation Issues\nIf you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.\nIf you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.\nThe default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and autoprotect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.\nWorkaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.\nDelete all snapshots for the virtual machine:\nSelect Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.\n(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.\nClick the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.\nClick Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.\nRebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:\nPower off the virtual machine.\nClick the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.\nUnder Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.\nDeselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.\nVMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.\nYou might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.\nAfter you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. \nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.\nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nA virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.\nVMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.\nInstallation can stall with the message, Please insert the \"<username>\" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.\nIf you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:\nInstall from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).\nInstall using a different user account that does not use FileVault.\nEasy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.\nWhen you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.\nYou must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.\nFor VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. \nHaving a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.\nBefore installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. \nIf you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.\nYou can remove those packages by running the following command as root\n$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default\nOr you can use the Software Management application in YaST:\nOpen YaST.\nClick on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).\nFind and click Software Management.\nRemove the packages.\nUser Interface Issues\nUnity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.\nWhen a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.\nIn some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.\nThis can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.\nWorkaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.\nOn MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.\nIn this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, \"A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers.\"\nTo work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nSelect Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.\nSelect Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.\nWith Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.\nIf you use command+d or control+option+d (\"show desktop\") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.\nWorkaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.\nCannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.\nThis problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.\nWhen you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.\nAero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.\nVirtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.\nWhen you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.\nWhile running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.\nThis occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.\nPutting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.\nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nKeyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.\nIf you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.\nThe size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.\nCopy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.\nBecause of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.\nQuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.\nOccasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.\nDisable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nHaving a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.\n3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: \"DirectX error message . . .\"\nIf the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.\nEditing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.\nVMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.\nGuest Operating System Issues\nDo not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.\nUsing fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.\nThe universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. \nThese physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.\nWorkaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine, and do not update the guest operating system until Apple releases 10.6.4.\nInstall GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. \nVMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, \"Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error\".\nOn SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.\nWorkaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.\nFrom the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.\nTo turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.\nIf you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.\nIf you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.\nSome dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.\nTo delete old dockers, take the following steps.\nSuspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.\nOpen the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.\nClose the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.\nNew dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.\nIn certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.\nOccasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.\nIn some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.\nIf you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:\nsvga.vramSize = \"33554432\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the virtual machine again.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nInstall Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.\nInstall Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nDo not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.\nIf you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.\nWorkaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.\nIf you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.\nIn a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.\nShared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.\nYou can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.\nWorkaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.\nVMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.\nIf you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.\nOld .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.\nWith VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\\\.host\\Shared Folders to \\\\vmware-host\\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.\nDefault applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.\nSetting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.\nIf a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.\nIf you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.\nSometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. \nThere are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating \"file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest.\" VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.\nWorking offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.\nUsing mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.\nWorkaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.\nThe Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.\nIn some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.\nDefault browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.\nIn certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.\nApplication Issues\nAudio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.\nPlayback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.\nSome 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.\nRunning certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.\nWorkaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.\n3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.\nIf you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.\nSelect Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.\nDeselect 3D.\nInternet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. \nIf you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, \"Protected Mode\" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\\\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.\nWorkaround:\nOpen Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.\nClick the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).\nClick Sites, then Advanced, type \\\\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.\nBack in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.\nClick OK, and accept the warning, \"The current security settings will put your computer at risk,\" by clicking OK again.\nClose Internet Explorer to apply the change.\nInternet Explorer will now open files from \\\\vmware-host correctly.\nSome games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.\nParts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.\nAfter quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.\nGalactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.\nThis problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.\nRunning certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.\nGames known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.\nRunning the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.\nOn a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.\nVirtual Machine Import Issues\nVMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.\nWhen you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.\nWhile importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).\nWorkaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nVMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.\nIf you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. \nTo work around this problem\nQuit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp\nDelete Boot Camp\nRestart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition\nFlat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.\nVMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.\nReconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.\nSome virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time.\" If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.\nUsing the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.\nIf this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nPC Migration Issues\nVMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.\nIf you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:\nInsufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)\nWorkaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.\nIf you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.\nIf the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.\nBecause of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.\nDo not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.\nFor instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, \"Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine.\"\nSound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.\nIf you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.\nWorkaround: Add a sound device.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nChoose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.\nIn the Removable Devices section, select Sound.\nClick Add Sound Device and close the window.\nPower on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.\nDevice Issues\nIf you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.\nConnecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.\nOn Mac OS X 1.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.\nUpgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 fixes this issue.\nIf you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.\nIf you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, \"The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size.\" However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.\nWorkaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.\nIf you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.\nHaving iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, \"iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes\". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: \"The iPad \"name\" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602).\"\nIf you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.\nAttempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.\nMounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.\nBuggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.\nOn Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.\nEnabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.\nSelecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.\nYou cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.\nIf you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.\nVMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.\nVMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.\nTo add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.\nIf you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.\nMiscellaneous Issues\nOVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.\nIf OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.\nWorkaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: \"$OVFTOOL_BIN\" \"$@\"\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following

To view release notes for the prior release of VMware Fusion 3, click the following link:\nVMware Fusion 3.0\nTop of Page\nOther VMware Fusion 3 Documentation\nGetting Started with VMware Fusion (PDF)—a compact guide on installing VMware Fusion and creating virtual machines.\nUsing vmrun to Control Virtual Machines (PDF)—a manual for developers and system administrators who want to control virtual machines on various platforms, including VMware Fusion.\nSystem Requirements for VMware Fusion\nMinimum System Requirements\nThe minimum system requirements for installing and using VMware Fusion are:\nAny Mac with an Intel processor\n1GB of RAM, 2GB recommended\n700MB of free disk space for VMware Fusion, and at least 5GB of free disk space for each virtual machine\nMac OS X version 10.5.8 or later; Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard or later\nOperating system installation media (disk or disk image) for virtual machines\nNote: You must have enough memory to run Mac OS X, plus the memory required for each guest operating system and for applications on the Mac and in the virtual machine. See your guest operating system and application documentation for their memory requirements.\nSystem Requirements for Aero and Unity View Performance\nThe following list describes the recommended minimum hardware required to provide Windows Vista and Windows 7 Aero functionality in Unity view without performance issues.\nIntel Core Duo 2.2GHz or better CPU\nNVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT, ATI Radeon HD 2600, or better GPU\nNote: Intel GMA 950 and X3100 GPUs do not support OpenGL 2.0, and do not support Aero\nGraphics Memory 256MB\nHost System Memory 2GB\nGuest Allocated Memory 1GB\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system.\nImportant: VMware Fusion now requires Mac OS X 10.5 (\"Leopard\") or later. It will not install on Mac OS X 10.4 (\"Tiger\").\nInstalling VMware Fusion 3 will overwrite earlier versions of the application.\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time, so if you install VMware Fusion 3 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, the VMware Fusion 3 version replaces the earlier version. This change does not affect your virtual machines. \nIf you want to revert to version 2.x or 1.x, you will need to reinstall it.\nWDDM is the Windows Display Driver Model for Vista and Windows 7. This is a new feature for VMware Fusion, and development has focused on Aero-specific support and stability. Other 3D games or applications might work, or might experience problems ranging from graphic corruption to crashes. Be sure to save any work in progress before experimenting with 3D games and applications.\nInstallation Notes\nVMware Tools\nIn order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion \"light\" installer (VMware-Fusion-<version-build>-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.\nIf you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-<version-build>.dmg or VMware-Fusion-<version-build>.iso).\nMcAfee Antivirus Products for Mac\nThere is an incompatibility between certain McAfee Mac antivirus products and VMware Fusion that can cause truncated virtual hard disk files (.vmdk) when you power off your Mac. This can happen with McAfee VirusScan for Mac 8.6.1, McAfee VirusScan for Mac 9.0, and McAfee Security for Mac 1.0.\nThis problem does not arise if you exclude your virtual machines from McAfee virus scans.\nTo prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.\nOn your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.\nClick Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.\nClick More Options.\nSelect Click lock to make changes.\nSelect Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.\nSelect the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.\nLock your changes and close the window.\nThe virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.\nNote: The incompatibility relates only to McAfee antivirus products running on the host Mac. Installing McAfee VirusScan Plus in your Windows virtual machines does not affect their virtual hard disks. VMware recommends running antivirus software in your virtual machines.\nPC Migration Notes\nFor some best practices and troubleshooting information, see \"Migration Assistant: A Guide\" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.\nVMware Fusion Migrate Your PC\nThe Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 2008 Server (not including R2). You can migrate a PC to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.7.\nThe VMware Fusion Migration Agent installer must be downloaded from the VMware web site and installed on the source PC. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac/.\n(md5 checksum: 7d25bf73545ae58534720d501adb3177)\nBefore migrating, make sure your Mac enables guests to connect to shared folders.\nOne of the steps in the migration process is to enable file sharing on your Mac. In addition, you must allow a guest to connect to the shared folder so that the virtual machine created from your PC can be migrated to the folder. On your Mac, go to System Preferences > Accounts > Guest Account and make sure Allow guests to connect to shared folders is enabled. If this is not enabled, the migration can fail with the message \"An error occurred while creating the virtual machine.\"\nBefore migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.\nIn the Control Panel, click Power Options.\nOn the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.\nBefore migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.\nThe Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.\nIf you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.\nThe simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.\nRight-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.\nSelect the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.\nYou cannot use the Migrate Your PC feature on a PC with a web server running on TCP port 443.\nThis includes users who have installed Microsoft's IIS web server, Apache, or another web server. Users who have installed Visual Studio will also be affected, since it installs Microsoft IIS by default.\nIf you have a third-party firewall, like ZoneAlarm, you must turn it off before migrating.\nAttempting to migrate with a third-party firewall enabled results in a connection error.\nYou cannot run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.\nIf you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you cannot run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.\nWorkaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nMigrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.\nAfter migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.\nStart the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.\nDownload a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).\nChange the SID of the migrated virtual machine.\nTools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion\nThe following issues are known to occur in VMware Fusion 3.0.1.\nIf you have upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard or have used Apple's Migration Assistant to move your system to a new computer, you might have to reinstall VMware Fusion.\nIn some cases, you might see a Software Update message announcing \"A new version of VMware Fusion is available\" in which the old and new build numbers are the same. This happens if the OS X install database gets wiped or not migrated, and therefore the VMware Fusion application cannot determine that it is already installed on the system.\nAlternatively, you might initiate an update, have it finish immediately, and after restarting VMware Fusion you are prompted for the same update.\nWorkaround: Reinstall VMware Fusion using the .dmg download image available through the VMware Fusion download page. http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_downloads/vmware_fusion_for_the_mac/3_0.\nAVG Free 9 does not work well with VMware Fusion 3.\nAVG Anti-Virus Free Edition 9 has high CPU usage after resuming a virtual machine due to its cache server having problems taking up to 100% CPU in Windows. This issue has been reported to AVG.\nWorkaround: VMware recommends new customers install the included McAfee VirusScan 12-month subscription. Upgrade customers can upgrade to the latest McAfee VirusScan with McAfee, or look at other free antivirus products such as Microsoft Security Essentials.\nYou can experience keyboard and mouse input delays when you boot a virtual machine running Mac OS X Server 10.6.2.\nWhen the Login window appears, nothing happens immediately when you click the mouse or type. If you wait an extended period after typing or clicking, around a minute, eventually everything you did is replayed and the boot can continue.\nVMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine. \nWhen you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nAttempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8. \nMounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.\nWorkaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.\nDriverless printing does not with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and Ubuntu 9.10.\nThe VMware virtual printer does not work with RHEL 5.4 and Ubuntu 9.10. \nWorkaround: Set up the desired printers separately in the Linux virtual machine.\nDo not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.\nIf you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.\nWorkaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.\nThe following issues are reprinted from the VMware Fusion 3.0 release notes. For the complete list of known issues, see http://www.vmware.com/support/fusion3/doc/releasenotes_fusion.html#issues\nInstallation Issues\nUser Interface Issues\nGuest Operating System Issues\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nInstallation Issues\nVMware Fusion installation fails if a broken version of MacFUSE already exists on your Mac.\nIf your installation of VMware Fusion fails with the message, The following install step failed: run postupgrade script for MacFUSE. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance, it is the result of an unsuccessfully installed version of MacFUSE already on the Mac that left a faulty symlink. To work around this problem you can either install VMware Fusion without MacFUSE or remove the faulty symlink before installing VMware Fusion with MacFUSE. \nTo confirm the symlink is faulty, look at the Kind displayed in the Get Info window for the fusefs.fs file.\nIn the Finder, go to //Library/Filesystems.\nRight-click on the file fusefs.fs to display the Get Info window.\n—If the Kind is Alias, the symlink is faulty.\n—If the Kind is File System Plug-in, the symlink is OK.\nTo install VMware Fusion without installing MacFUSE:\nRestart the installer.\nOn the Installation Type panel, click Customize to go to the Custom Install pane.\nDeselect MacFuse, click Install, and continue with the installation.\nTo install VMware Fusion with MacFUSE:\nIn the Finder, go to //Library/Filesystems.\nDelete or rename the file fusefs.fs.\nRestart the installer and continue with a Standard Install.\nYou might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.\nAfter you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine.\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.\nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nUser Interface Issues\nVMware Fusion does not support Bridged networking to a VPN.\nIf you attempt to connect to a VPN with Bridged networking in a virtual machine, it might result in a \"/dev/vmnet0 is not running\" error. If this message appears, lower the network priority of the VPN service on the host. You can do this in System Preferences > Network.\nWhen you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.\nAero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.\nVirtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.\nWhen you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.\nWhile running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.\nThis occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.\nA virtual machine's window might become gray or black and unresponsive when exiting Unity view.\nWorkaround: Suspend and resume the virtual machine. It should display properly. If not, quit or force quit VMware Fusion, and restart.\nDo not upgrade or uninstall VMware Tools in Unity view.\nUpgrading or uninstalling VMware Tools while you are working in Unity view can result in garbled windows at the completion of the process.\nWorkaround: If you find yourself in this situation, restart the virtual machine.\nGuest Operating System Issues\nIn certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.\nOccasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.\nFile and Application Sharing Issues\nIf you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.\nIn a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.\nShared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.\nYou can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.\nWorkaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.\nYou might get a \"File cannot be opened by the host\" message when you attempt to open an Outlook attachment in a virtual machine with an application on your Mac.\nIf you enable ~/Documents as a shared folder while Outlook is running in the virtual machine, an Outlook attachment cannot immediately be opened with an application on the Mac. Workaround: Restart Outlook.\nVMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.\nIf you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 3"},{"entry":"Other VMware Fusion 3 Documentation","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Other VMware Fusion 3 Documentation"},{"entry":"System Requirements for VMware Fusion","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"System Requirements for VMware Fusion"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"PC Migration Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"PC Migration Notes"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.0.1","ReleaseDate":"10/12/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 3.0.1 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 3.

{"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nBefore You Begin\nResolved Issues\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion 2.0.8 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 1 and VMware Fusion 2 customers.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion 2 are described in the release notes for each release. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0.7\nVMware Fusion 2.0.6\nVMware Fusion 2.0.5\nVMware Fusion 2.0.4\nVMware Fusion 2.0.3\nVMware Fusion 2.0.2\nVMware Fusion 2.0.1\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nOn VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0.8 overwrites earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.8 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.8 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThis release resolves the following issue:\nA vulnerability in the input validation of VMware Tools update allows for injection of commands. This issue could allow a user on the host to execute commands on the guest operating system with root privileges. The issue can only be exploited if VMware Tools is not fully up-to-date. Windows-based virtual machines are not affected.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4297 to this issue.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe following issues are known to occur in VMware Fusion 2.0.8:\nOn Mac OS X 10.6 and later, VMware Fusion Help might not be available after switching languages in System Preferences\nIf you access VMware Fusion Help after switching languages, the help viewer might display empty pages instead of displaying the in-product help.\nWorkaround:\nClose the help window and quit VMware Fusion.\nIn Finder, go to your Home folder > Library > Caches and delete the folders com.apple.helpd and com.apple.helpviewer.\nIn Finder, go to your Home folder > Preferences and delete the files com.apple.helpd.plist and com.apple.helpviewer.plist.\nOpen Activity Monitor.app, select All Processes in the pop-down menu in the task bar, and quit the helpd process if it is running.\nStart VMware Fusion and open Help.\nThe help content should now appear.\nVMware Tools does not get updated automatically when you upgrade from VMware Fusion 2.0.5 to VMware Fusion 2.0.7\nFor VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work after you upgrade from VMware Fusion 2.0.5 to VMware Fusion 2.0.7. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nFile links in Microsoft Office applications in a Windows virtual machine don't work\nIf you used the Default Applications feature with your Windows virtual machine in a VMware Fusion 2 release, and upgrade to VMware Fusion 2.0.7, hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents might not work.\nWorkaround:\nUpdate VMware Tools to the latest version.\nIn your Windows virtual machine remove the ForceShellExecute registry key from the following location: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\9.0\\Common\\Internet.\nWhen being installed on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), VMware Fusion does not install MacFUSE \nMacFUSE might cause the installer to fail or become non responsive, so the VMware Fusion installation process does not install it by default on a Mac with OS X 10.6.\nMouse driver error when importing Windows XP Professional or Windows Server 2003 virtual machine from Parallels Desktop 4\nThe following error might be displayed during the VMware Tools installation when you import a Windows XP Professional or Windows Server 2003 virtual machine from Parallels Desktop 4: Setup failed to install the mouse driver automatically. This driver will have to be installed manually. \nThis error can be ignored. The mouse works properly in the imported virtual machine.\nSelecting the Sleep option on a Mac OS X Server guest operating system causes it to stop responding \nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine might stop responding. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure that in the Energy Saver window of Apple > System Preferences, the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider is set to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nCopy operation fails in a Mac OS X Server 10.6 guest operating system\nCopying files from a Mac OS X Server 10.6 guest operating system to a shared folder might fail with the following error message: Copy: The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privileges for some of the items \nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Intel Xeon 5500 or 3500 series processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Intel Xeon 5500 or 3500 series processors (based on Nehalem micro-architecture) might fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: Add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nPower off the virtual machine and exit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower on the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine\nWhile importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value). \nWorkaround: Set the Parallels 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default).\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. This message does not indicate registry corruption or data loss.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library. \nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail.\nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications.\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again.\nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database.\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.8","ReleaseDate":"02/12/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.8 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0.6\nVMware Fusion 2.0.5\nVMware Fusion 2.0.4\nVMware Fusion 2.0.3\nVMware Fusion 2.0.2\nVMware Fusion 2.0.1\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nOn VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0.7 overwrites earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.7 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.7 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThis release resolves the following issues:\nPotential information leak via hosted networking stack\nA vulnerability in the virtual networking stack of VMware hosted products could allow host information disclosure.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1138 to this issue.\nvmrun format string vulnerability\nA format string vulnerability in vmrun could allow arbitrary code execution.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1139 to this issue.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nThe following issues are known to occur in VMware Fusion 2.0.7:\nOn Mac OS X 10.6 and later, VMware Fusion Help might not be available after switching languages in System Preferences\nIf you access VMware Fusion Help after switching languages, the help viewer might display empty pages instead of displaying the in-product help.\nWorkaround:\nClose the help window and quit VMware Fusion.\nIn Finder, go to your Home folder > Library > Caches and delete the folders com.apple.helpd and com.apple.helpviewer.\nIn Finder, go to your Home folder > Preferences and delete the files com.apple.helpd.plist and com.apple.helpviewer.plist.\nOpen Activity Monitor.app, select All Processes in the pop-down menu in the task bar, and quit the helpd process if it is running.\nStart VMware Fusion and open Help.\nThe help content should now appear.\nVMware Tools does not get updated automatically when you upgrade from VMware Fusion 2.0.5 to VMware Fusion 2.0.7\nFor VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work after you upgrade from VMware Fusion 2.0.5 to VMware Fusion 2.0.7. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.\nFile links in Microsoft Office applications in a Windows virtual machine don't work\nIf you used the Default Applications feature with your Windows virtual machine in a VMware Fusion 2 release, and upgrade to VMware Fusion 2.0.7, hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents might not work.\nWorkaround:\nUpdate VMware Tools to the latest version.\nIn your Windows virtual machine remove the ForceShellExecute registry key from the following location: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\9.0\\Common\\Internet.\nWhen being installed on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), VMware Fusion does not install MacFUSE \nMacFUSE might cause the installer to fail or become non responsive, so the VMware Fusion installation process does not install it by default on a Mac with OS X 10.6.\nMouse driver error when importing Windows XP Professional or Windows Server 2003 virtual machine from Parallels Desktop 4\nThe following error might be displayed during the VMware Tools installation when you import a Windows XP Professional or Windows Server 2003 virtual machine from Parallels Desktop 4: Setup failed to install the mouse driver automatically. This driver will have to be installed manually. \nThis error can be ignored. The mouse works properly in the imported virtual machine.\nSelecting the Sleep option on a Mac OS X Server guest operating system causes it to stop responding \nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine might stop responding. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure that in the Energy Saver window of Apple > System Preferences, the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider is set to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nCopy operation fails in a Mac OS X Server 10.6 guest operating system\nCopying files from a Mac OS X Server 10.6 guest operating system to a shared folder might fail with the following error message: Copy: The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privileges for some of the items \nWorkaround: None.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Intel Xeon 5500 or 3500 series processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Intel Xeon 5500 or 3500 series processors (based on Nehalem micro-architecture) might fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: Add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nPower off the virtual machine and exit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower on the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine\nWhile importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value). \nWorkaround: Set the Parallels 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default).\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. This message does not indicate registry corruption or data loss.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library. \nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail.\nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications.\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again.\nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database.\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.7","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.7 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail. \nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, use the following workaround to boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. \nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) \nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. \nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.6","ReleaseDate":"01/10/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.6 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

{"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nBefore You Begin\nResolved Issues\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion 2.0.5 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 1 and VMware Fusion 2 customers, and provides the following enhancements:\nSupports Mac OS X Server guest operating systems on Macs with Intel Xeon 5500 and 3500 Series processors (based on Nehalem micro-architecture)\nProvides experimental support for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard Server as a guest operating system (32-bit only)\nProvides experimental support for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard as a host operating system (32-bit only)\nSupports Ubuntu 9.04 as a guest operating system, including features such as VMware Tools pre-built modules and Easy Install\nReduces CPU usage when a virtual machine is idle under VMware Fusion\nContains fixes for more than 80 bugs\nNote: 3D acceleration is disabled on systems with ATI chipsets. For more information, see the Known Issues section below.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion 2 are described in the release notes for each release. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0.4\nVMware Fusion 2.0.3\nVMware Fusion 2.0.2\nVMware Fusion 2.0.1\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nOn VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0.5 overwrites earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.5 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.5 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThis release resolves issues in the following subject areas:\nHost-Guest File System (HGFS)\nNetworking\nGraphics\nDrag and Drop\nUSB\nBoot Camp\nHost-Guest File System (HGFS)\nAvast! causes shared folder operations to slow down \nRunning Avast! antivirus software in a Windows virtual machine might cause a delay in accessing files on a shared folder or mirrored folder. \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nShared folder operations fail while using subversion (SVN) software \nWhile using SVN software (for example, TortoiseSVN) to access SVN repositories stored on a shared folder, certain operations might fail. \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nWindows XP virtual machine fails while accessing a shared folder \nA Windows XP (64-bit) guest operating system might fail with a blue screen while performing intensive file I/O on a shared folder.\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nWindows XP virtual machine fails while accessing Personal STore (PST) file on a shared folder\nIn a Windows virtual machine, accessing a PST file located in a shared folder using Microsoft Outlook might cause the virtual machine to fail with a blue screen. \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nNetworking\nNetwork connection fails in NAT mode\nNetwork connection on a virtual machine that uses network address translation (NAT) mode might fail after the virtual machine runs for some time. \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nSuspend/resume operation affects network connectivity in a Ubuntu 9.04 virtual machine\nIn a Ubuntu 9.04 virtual machine, the network stays active after the virtual machine is suspended. When this happens, the network does not come up when the virtual machine is resumed.\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5. \nGraphics\nMac OS X WindowServer stops responding on a Mac with NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 or GT 130 graphics cards\nOn a Mac OS X with NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 or GT 130 graphics card, running certain 3D applications in a Windows virtual machine might cause the Mac WindowServer to stop responding. \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nDrag and Drop\nCPU usage spikes during Unity drag and drop operation\nIn a Windows XP Professional virtual machine, the VMwareUser.exe process (part of VMware Tools) might use 100% of the CPU and cause the virtual machine to stop responding. \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nUSB\nWindows XP virtual machine does not detect eToken encryption device in pre-boot environment\nAfter you install Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software with an eToken encryption device from Aladdin Systems in a Windows XP virtual machine, the eToken device might not be detected in the virtual machine pre-boot environment. This might cause the whole-disk-encryption feature in the PGP software to stop working.\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nBoot Camp\nSetting up a Boot Camp virtual machine on a hard drive larger than 1.5TB fails \nIn releases prior to VMware Fusion 2.0.5, a Boot Camp partition that is on a hard drive larger than 1.5TB cannot be set up to run as a virtual machine. With VMware Fusion 2.0.5, you can set up a Boot Camp virtual machine on a hard drive up to 2TB in size.\nStandby mode causes a Boot Camp virtual machine to go into a nonresponsive state \nAfter your Boot Camp virtual machine enters standby state either triggered by Windows power management settings or by selecting Stand by from the Start > Shut down menu, it might become non-responsive.\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.5.\nKnown Issues\n3D acceleration is disabled on systems with ATI chipsets\nBecause enabling 3D acceleration on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.7 with ATI chipsets might cause VMware Fusion to fail, 3D acceleration is disabled in VMware Fusion 2.0.5 on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.7 with ATI chipsets. You can re-enable this setting when new ATI drivers with the fix are available.\nFile links in Microsoft Office applications in a Windows virtual machine don't work\nIf you used the Default Applications feature with your Windows virtual machine in a VMware Fusion 2 release, and upgrade to VMware Fusion 2.0.5, hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents might not work.\nWorkaround:\nUpdate VMware Tools to the latest version.\nIn your Windows virtual machine remove the ForceShellExecute registry key from the following location: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\9.0\\Common\\Internet.\nWhen being installed on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), VMware Fusion does not install MacFUSE \nMacFUSE might cause the installer to fail or become non responsive, so the VMware Fusion installation process does not install it by default on a Mac with OS X 10.6.\nMouse driver error when importing Windows XP Professional or Windows Server 2003 virtual machine from Parallels Desktop 4\nThe following error might be displayed during the VMware Tools installation when you import a Windows XP Professional or Windows Server 2003 virtual machine from Parallels Desktop 4: Setup failed to install the mouse driver automatically. This driver will have to be installed manually. \nThis error can be ignored. The mouse works properly in the imported virtual machine.\nSelecting the Sleep option on a Mac OS X Server guest operating system causes it to stop responding \nThe default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine might stop responding. \nWorkaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure that in the Energy Saver window of Apple > System Preferences, the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider is set to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.\nCopy operation fails in a Mac OS X Server 10.6 guest operating system\nCopying files from a Mac OS X Server 10.6 guest operating system to a shared folder might fail with the following error message: Copy: The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privileges for some of the items \nWorkaround: None. \nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Intel Xeon 5500 or 3500 series processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Intel Xeon 5500 or 3500 series processors (based on Nehalem micro-architecture) might fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: Add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nPower off the virtual machine and exit VMware Fusion.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower on the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine\nWhile importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value). \nWorkaround: Set the Parallels 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nVMware Tools is not automatically installed after using Linux Easy Install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2\nWorkaround: Select Install VMware Tools from the Virtual Machine menu to start manual installation of VMware Tools, and follow the instructions in VMware Fusion Help topic \"Installing or Upgrading VMware Tools in a Linux Virtual Machine from the Command Line with the Tar Installer.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. This message does not indicate registry corruption or data loss.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library. \nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail. \nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, use the following workaround to boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. \nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) \nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. \nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.5","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.5 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

{"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nBefore You Begin\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion 2.0.4 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 1 and VMware Fusion 2 customers, and has the fix for the following critical security issue:\nHost code execution vulnerability from a guest operating system\nA critical vulnerability in the virtual machine display function might allow a guest operating system to run code on the host. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-1244 to this issue.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion 2 are described in the release notes for each release. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0.3\nVMware Fusion 2.0.2\nVMware Fusion 2.0.1\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nOn VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0.4 overwrites earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.4 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.4 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nEnabling 3D acceleration on systems with new chipsets and running 3D applications within VMware Fusion might cause your virtual machine to fail\nEnabling 3D acceleration on the Mac Pros and iMacs released in March 2009 that ship with the new ATI Radeon HD 4850 and 4870 chipsets might cause VMware Fusion to fail.\nWorkaround: Turn off 3D acceleration by deselecting Accelerate 3D Graphics in Virtual Machine > Settings > Display when the virtual machine is powered off.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on the new Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a new Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nLatest Snow Leopard seed does not install as a guest operating system on the Nehalem Mac Pro\nThe installation fails with the error message, Virtual machine kernal stack fault (hardware reset).\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine\nWhile importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value). \nWorkaround: Set the Parallels 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nVMware Tools is not automatically installed after using Linux Easy Install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2\nWorkaround: Select Install VMware Tools from the Virtual Machine menu to start manual installation of VMware Tools, and follow the instructions in VMware Fusion Help topic \"Installing or Upgrading VMware Tools in a Linux Virtual Machine from the Command Line with the Tar Installer.\nStandby mode causes a Boot Camp virtual machine to go into a non-responsive state \nAfter your Boot Camp virtual machine enters standby state either triggered by Windows power management settings or by selecting Stand by from the Start > Shut down menu, it might become non-responsive.\nWorkaround: Disable Windows power management in your Boot Camp virtual machine.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. This message does not indicate registry corruption or data loss.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library. \nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail. \nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, use the following workaround to boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. \nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) \nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. \nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.4","ReleaseDate":"10/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.4 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

{"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nBefore You Begin\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion 2.0.3 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 1 and VMware Fusion 2 customers, and has the following enhancements and fixes for critical customer issues:\nResolves an issue where driverless printing stops working for users that run Mac OS X 10.5.6, and installed Apple Mac OS X Security Update 2009-001. The shared printers would disappear from Windows. If you configured your printer differently as a workaround, turn on driverless printing feature again by clicking Virtual Machine > Settings, selecting Printers, and selecting the Enabled check box.\nProvides experimental support for Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server as a guest operating system. You can now run the latest Snow Leopard Server build (32-bit kernel) released before April 2009 in a virtual machine.\nResolves an issue with driverless printing, where the Enabled check box on Virtual Machine > Settings > Printers might get deselected automatically.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion 2 are described in the release notes for each release. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0.2\nVMware Fusion 2.0.1\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nOn VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0.3 overwrites earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.3 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.3 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nEnabling 3D acceleration on systems with new chipsets and running 3D applications within VMware Fusion might cause your virtual machine to fail\nEnabling 3D acceleration on the Mac Pros and iMacs released in March 2009 that ship with the new ATI Radeon HD 4850 and 4870 chipsets might cause VMware Fusion to fail.\nWorkaround: Turn off 3D acceleration by deselecting Accelerate 3D Graphics in Virtual Machine > Settings > Display when the virtual machine is powered off.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nCannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on the new Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors \nThe installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a new Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. \nWorkaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.\nNavigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.\nRight click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.\nIn a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:\nmonitor.virtual_exec=\"hardware\"\nmonitor.virtual_mmu=\"software\"\nSave the file.\nPower up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.\nLatest Snow Leopard seed does not install as a guest operating system on the Nehalem Mac Pro\nThe installation fails with the error message, Virtual machine kernal stack fault (hardware reset).\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine\nWhile importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value). \nWorkaround: Set the Parallels 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nVMware Tools is not automatically installed after using Linux Easy Install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2\nWorkaround: Select Install VMware Tools from the Virtual Machine menu to start manual installation of VMware Tools, and follow the instructions in VMware Fusion Help topic \"Installing or Upgrading VMware Tools in a Linux Virtual Machine from the Command Line with the Tar Installer.\nStandby mode causes a Boot Camp virtual machine to go into a non-responsive state \nAfter your Boot Camp virtual machine enters standby state either triggered by Windows power management settings or by selecting Stand by from the Start > Shut down menu, it might become non-responsive.\nWorkaround: Disable Windows power management in your Boot Camp virtual machine.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. This message does not indicate registry corruption or data loss.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library. \nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail. \nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, use the following workaround to boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. \nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) \nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. \nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.3","ReleaseDate":"02/04/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.3 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

{"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ReleaseContents":"These release notes cover the following topics:\nWhat's New\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nBefore You Begin\nResolved Issues\nKnown Issues\nWhat's New\nVMware Fusion 2.0.2 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 1 and VMware Fusion 2 customers, and has the following enhancements:\nAllows importing Windows virtual machines from both Parallels Desktop 4.0 and Parallels Server for Mac.\nSupports mounting unencrypted .dmg file format as a CD/DVD disk image, in addition to .iso file format.\nSupports Mac OS X 10.5.6 as a host operating system.\nProvides experimental support for Mac OS X Server 10.5.6 as a guest operating system.\nSupports Ubuntu 8.10 as a guest operating system, including features such as VMware Tools with prebuilt kernel modules, Easy Install, and Unity.\nShips with a 12-month complimentary subscription to McAfee VirusScan Plus 2009 antivirus software, with localization support for French, German, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.\nProvides performance improvements when browsing mirrored folders and shared folders in Windows virtual machines.\nSupports display of Windows applications in Unity view as 48 pixel x 48 pixel icons.\nResolves issues with \"Optimize for Mac OS application performance\" preference option for Mac OS X 10.5.5 and later.\nContains bug fixes described in Resolved Issues.\nNote: Two .dmg files of VMware Fusion are available for download. One contains McAfee VirusScan Plus, the other does not. Download either based on your download preferences.\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion 2 are described in the release notes for each release. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0.1\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nOn VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0.2 overwrites earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.2 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.2 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThe following issues, reported in the VMware Fusion 2.0.1 release notes or discussed in the user community, have been resolved in 2.0.2:\nVirtual machine stops responding after upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.1\nGuest operating systems might stop responding at random after upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.1. Suspending and resuming the virtual machine might solve the issue temporarily.  An error message similar to the following might be displayed in the vmware log file:\nDec 09 17:08:27.668: vcpu-0| PICAckINTR: Spurious INTR, EXC_NONE\nDec 09 17:08:27.668: vcpu-0| PICAckINTR: Spurious INTR, EXC_NONE\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nSelecting the option Optimize for Mac OS application performance has no effect on performance \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.  VMware Fusion now uses significantly less memory when the performance option is selected. This fix applies only to Mac OS X versions 10.5.5 and later.\nCopy-paste and drag-and-drop operations do not work reliably from host to guest operating system and vice-versa in Unity mode\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nVMware Fusion does not set the correct time zone when installing Windows Vista and later guest operating systems\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nVMware Fusion installer incorrectly prompts system reboot \nWhile installing VMware Fusion, the installer might incorrectly display the error message VMware Fusion cannot be installed on this computer. A system reboot is required before installing VMware Fusion under certain conditions. Rebooting the system does not help resolve the issue.\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2. The message displayed is now context-sensitive.\nIssues with Mac OS X Server 10.5.6 guest operating system running on a VMware Fusion 2.0/2.0.1 virtual machine\nMac OS X Server 10.5.6 guest operating systems running in a VMware Fusion 2.0/2.0.1 virtual machine might experience issues where only a gray window is displayed instead of the graphical user interface, and USB keyboards and other USB devices do not work with the default setting. \nThese issues are resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nMac OS X Server (10.5.5 and earlier) guest operating system cannot be installed on a virtual machine on the Fall 2008 MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nShared folders and mirrored folders respond slowly when accessed for the first time\nYou might experience slow response times while trying to access the contents of shared folders and mirrored folders from a Windows virtual machine, for the first time.  \nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nUSB devices fail to auto connect on Windows Vista virtual machines after restart\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nThinPrint software causes reinstall or reconfiguration issues with third-party applications such as Adobe Acrobat\nEach time you start a Windows session and launch Windows Explorer or any other application, an issue with the ThinPrint software might cause third-party applications such as Adobe Acrobat to reinstall. \nThis issue is resolved with VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nVMware Tools does not work after upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.1\nUpgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.1 might result in VMware Tools not working. With Unity and during copy-paste operations, VMware Fusion might fail. Reinstalling VMware Tools and rebooting the virtual machine does not resolve the issue.\nThis issue is resolved in VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nPerformance issues after upgrading to Java JRE 1.6 Update 10\nFor Java2D rendering, Java JRE 1.6 Update 10 now uses Direct3D by default if available. Upgrading to Java JRE 1.6 Update 10 might cause performance issues with the VMware Fusion 3D pipeline, with Java applets becoming slow or unresponsive. \nVMware Fusion now sets the J2D_D3D environment variable to false when starting the vmtools service so that the Java2D system does not make use of Direct3D accelerated graphics on Windows. \nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nVMware Tools upgrade fails in non-English language Windows virtual machines\nAfter upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.2 Build 146107, a VMware Tools upgrade might fail with internal error 2229 in a non-English language Windows virtual machine. This failure might occur during VMware Tools auto upgrade after powering on and logging in to the virtual machine, or when you manually start the VMware Tools upgrade by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the virtual machine menu.\nWorkaround: Download the newer VMware Fusion Build 147997 and reinstall VMware Fusion 2.0.2.\nVMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines\nInstallation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\\\.psf\\Home\\Documents.\nWorkaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.\nVMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine\nWhile importing a Parallels 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value). \nWorkaround: Set the Parallels 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:\nSelect Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.\nSelect Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.\nSelect the Show advanced settings check box.\nSelect 0:0 in the Location box.\nVMware Tools is not automatically installed after using Linux Easy Install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2\nWorkaround: Select Install VMware Tools from the Virtual Machine menu to start manual installation of VMware Tools, and follow the instructions in VMware Fusion Help topic \"Installing or Upgrading VMware Tools in a Linux Virtual Machine from the Command Line with the Tar Installer.\"\nStandby mode causes a Boot Camp virtual machine to go into a non-responsive state \nAfter your Boot Camp virtual machine enters standby state either triggered by Windows power management settings or by selecting Stand by from the Start > Shut down menu, it might become non-responsive.\nWorkaround: Disable Windows power management in your Boot Camp virtual machine.\nRegistry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system \nAfter importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. This message does not indicate registry corruption or data loss.\nUnable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine\nInstallation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library. \nWorkaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.\nDisplay-related issues with Google Earth\nThe opening display of Google Earth appears fractured, and lines appear textured.\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nKey mapping issues with Ctrl and Shift\nIf you assign additional functions to Shift and Ctrl keys by using key mapping, performing multiple selections in a virtual machine might fail. \nWorkaround: Remove key mappings for key combinations that contain modifier keys. Alternatively, you can disable all keyboard remapping.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in\nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Borland's Delphi when writing applications that you want to run on virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed. \nThere is no workaround for this issue.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac\nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed on one Mac, the Mac OS X stops responding while booting or shutting down. \nIf you encounter this issue, use the following workaround to boot your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected\nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. \nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:\nStart the virtual machine and log in.\nBefore clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands:\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD\nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. \nWorkaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). \nWorkaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. \nWorkaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) \nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. \nWorkaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. \nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine\nIf you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.2","ReleaseDate":"11/02/2009","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.2 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

It has the following enhancements:\nContains bug fixes described in Resolved Issues\nNow shows application badge instead of generic document icons when assigning Windows applications to Mac documents\nGreatly reduced initial pause when opening mirrored or shared folders\nNo longer disables certain shared folders and mirrored folders that were nested folders. The potential data loss issue with nested shared folders has been resolved\nNo longer publishes Windows guest applications to Mac if Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac is unchecked in virtual machine Settings > Sharing\nAutoProtect postpones taking a snapshot when the user is interacting with the virtual machine\nNo longer maps Num Pad Enter to AltGr by default for non-European keyboards\nBrings back the Enable Hints menu item in Help menu\nPrior Releases of VMware Fusion 2\nFeatures from prior releases of VMware Fusion 2 are described in the release notes for each release. To view release notes for prior releases of VMware Fusion 2, click one of the following links:\nVMware Fusion 2.0\nTop of Page\nBefore You Begin\nVMware recommends that you do not update your virtual machines to Mac OS X 10.5.6 Server at this time\nAn OS X Server 10.5.6 guest operating system running in a VMware Fusion 2.0/2.0.1 virtual machine can experience issues in which the you see only a gray window instead of the graphical user interface, and in which USB keyboards and other USB devices do not work with the default setting. To avoid this problem, VMware recommends that you do not update your guest operating system until the next VMware Fusion maintenance software release. Take a snapshot of your OS X Server 10.5.5 virtual machine as a precaution so that you can have a good known state to revert to in case an automatic update to OS X Server 10.5.6 happens.\nIf a virtual machine has been updated to OS X Server 10.5.6 and there is no snapshot of an OS X Server 10.5.5 in a good known state, there are two workarounds to return some level of functionality to the virtual machine.\nFor issues with the GUI, disable vmware-tools-guestd following these five steps. You need to have MacFUSE installed as part of the VMware Fusion installations.\nPower off the virtual machine.\nBrowse to the virtual machine in Finder (under ~/Documents/Virtual Machines by default).\nControl-click or right-click on the virtual machine, select More > Mount Virtual Disk > Mount All.\nBrowse to the mounted virtual machine volume in Finder, then go to the virtual machine's /Library/LaunchDaemons folder.\nOpen the file com.vmware.launchd.tools.plist and change the value of RunAtLoad to false.\nFor issues with the USB keyboard, open the .vmx file in an editor and edit the USB deviceType:\nChange the line \nusb:1.deviceType = \"hub\" \nto \nusb:1.deviceType = \"keyboard\"\nThere is no known fix for enabling other USB devices.\nTop of Page\nResolved Issues\nThe following issues, reported in the VMware Fusion 2.0 release notes or discussed in the user community, have been resolved in 2.0.1:\nVMwareUser taking 100% CPU after certain drag-and-drop operations. \nThis problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nA number of performance issues for VMware Fusion 2. \nA number of performance issues were identified for VMware Fusion2:\nGuest start menu traversal slow when it contains broken shortcuts (Windows XP and earlier only)\nHigh CPU utilization by VMwareUser.exe when first starting up\nSlow boot when iSight (product ID 0x8502 as reported by System Profiler) attached to virtual machine\nLoad time of the Virtual Machine Library on Fusion startup after the first startup\nThese problems have been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nRunning certain video games and other 3D applications in Fusion 2 on the new MacBook or MacBook Pro, or the MacBook Air, can freeze the Mac. \nThis problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2 changes the default browser or other default application. \nIn certain cases during installation, VMware Fusion would reassign the first browser it found as the default browser, or reassign another of the default applications for handling URLs. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nUpgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.1 does not restore already-changed settings, however. You can change the default browser in Safari's Preferences or with the third-party RCDefaultApp. http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/\nTake Snapshot incorrectly enabled for some Boot Camp virtual machines. \nVMware Fusion 2.0.1 fixes a problem in which for certain Boot Camp virtual machines, the Take Snapshot button was enabled, which it should not have been.\nGray boxes obscure part of window in Unity view. \nThis problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nDaily or weekly AutoProtect snapshots are not being taken. \nVMware Fusion 2.0.1 corrects a problem in which daily or weekly snapshots in AutoProtect were not being taken.\nDrag-and-drop does not work if the color depth is set to 16-bit in the guest operating system. \nHaving the color depth in Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Vista set to 16-bit no longer prevents dragging-and-dropping.\nCVSNT and VMware Tools are incompatible. \nThe known incompatibility between CVSNT (http://www.cvsnt.org) and VMware Tools has been fixed. You no longer have to uninstall CVSNT if you want to install VMware Tools to use Unity view, and to use cut-copy-paste or drag-and-drop between your virtual machine and your Mac.\nRunning Google Earth with 3D acceleration enabled can cause the virtual machine to unexpectedly quit. \nWith VMware Fusion 2.0.1, the virtual machine no longer quits unexpectedly when running Google Earth with 3D acceleration enabled, so you do not need to disable 3D acceleration in the VMware Fusion preferences.\nApplication Dock tile disappears in Unity view after a snapshot. \nThe Dock tile for a guest application no longer disappears if you click on it after you take a snapshot in Unity view.\nSuspending a virtual machine located on a FileVault encrypted volume makes the system unresponsive. \nFor non-English Mac OS X users, when suspending a virtual machine that's stored on a FileVault encrypted volume, Mac OS X might become unresponsive. VMware Fusion 2.0.1 works around this issue.\nDrag and drop stops working in a Linux virtual machine after an alert message. \nPreviously, if you encountered an alert message while attempting a drag and drop in a Linux virtual machine, you might have had to quit and restart VMware Fusion to get drag-and-drop to work again. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nDownloading files with Safari in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might fail when using NAT as networking type. \nVMware Fusion 2.0.1 fixes a problem in which using NAT as networking type for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might have resulted in Safari downloads timing out.\nWith a shared file, moving or copying it to its existing location by a different path can cause data loss. \nPrevious to version 2.0.1, VMware Fusion attempted to disable shared folders that would create a risk of data loss if you moved or copied a shared file to its existing location by a different path. With VMware Fusion 2.0.1 the risk of data loss is removed, and VMware Fusion therefore no longer disables shared folders in those situations.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine hangs during auto update of Tools. \nWhen powering on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine that was created in a previous version of VMware Fusion, it was possible for the virtual machine to hang while in the middle of the tools auto upgrade process. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nApplications that use Multiple Document Interface (MDI), such as Microsoft Excel, might not display correctly in Unity view. \nThese applications now display correctly.\nIn some cases, setting your Mac to \"Mirror Displays\" results in windows not appearing in Unity view. \nIf one of your displays is rotated to vertical (portrait) orientation, or you use a Mac Pro with multiple graphics cards, setting your Mac to mirror displays could cause windows to disappear in Unity view. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.\nTop of Page\nKnown Issues\nMac OS X Server (10.5.5 and earlier) cannot be installed in a virtual machine on the new Fall 2008 MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air.\nThe Fall 2008 update to the MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air requires a newer version of Mac OS X Server than the most recent version (10.5.5). If you encounter problems installing Mac OS X Server in a virtual machine on these systems, make sure your Mac can boot from the installation disc.\nEasy Install doesn't work for Ubuntu 8.10. Ubuntu 8.10 is not officially supported and Easy Install is not available for the guest installation due to the lack of pre-built tools. Perform the standard installation, and install VMware Tools following the Guest Operating System Installation Guide. After VMware Tools is installed, many features should work. If you experience issues with your mouse not ungrabbing, run the Ubuntu Update Manager and ensure that you are running with the latest Ubuntu updates.\nDo not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac. \nWhen both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed in the Mac, the Mac OS X freezes while booting or shutting down. Do not install both applications on a Mac.\nIf you have encountered this, follow this workaround to boot up your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:\nMake sure the Mac is powered off.\nPress the power button.\nPress and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.\nUninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.\nReboot the Mac.\nVMware Fusion 2 does not directly import Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machines.\nDue to a recent change to the Parallels virtual machine file format, VMware Fusion 2 can not directly import Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machines. To work around this, download and install VMware Converter for Windows in your Parallels virtual machine, uninstall Parallels Tools, and run the VMware Converter to import the PC. Detailed steps are at http://www.vmware.com/download/fusion/windows_to_mac.html.\nUpgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. \nOn some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Normally the drivers for them will be silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware may trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop, there are just a lot of new ones. \nWorkaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to install. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again.\nPCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware. \nIn certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine and the PCI-to-PCI bridges will fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens the New Hardware Found dialog displays every time you reboot and log in, and when you try to install the drivers, the install fails. \nWorkaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database by:\nStart the virtual machine and log in\nBefore clicking on anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe\nIn the CMD window, type the following commands\nC:\ncd \\windows\\inf\ndel infcache.1\nexit\nClick Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.\nCannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in. \nIf you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Delphi when writing applications that you want to run in virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed.\nDVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD. \nBecause of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. Workaround: Use VLC Player.\nSlow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations.\nWhen Windows drive letters are mapped to non-existent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). Workaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, then disconnecting the troublesome drives.\nSlow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software.\nA slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)\nSlow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2.\nWindows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.\nDo not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine.\nPlugging a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which you disabled USB 2.0 support causes the virtual machine to fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message \"The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller\" when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system\" when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"These release notes cover the following topics:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"These release notes cover the following topics:"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Prior Releases of VMware Fusion 2"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Resolved Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Resolved Issues"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"What's New","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0.1","ReleaseDate":"14/11/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0.1 is a maintenance release of VMware Fusion 2.

See your guest operating system and application documentation for their memory requirements.\nBefore You Begin\nUse the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system.\nFor Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) we recommend version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) we recommend Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.\nLeopard provides the best 3D experience on VMware Fusion. Running on Tiger results in a comparatively worse 3D experience.\nInstalling VMware Fusion 2.0 will overwrite earlier versions of the application\nIt is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time, so if you install VMware Fusion 2.0 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 1.x, the 2.0 version replaces the earlier version. If you want to revert to version 1.x, you will need to reinstall it.\nInstallation Notes\nUpgrading Your Virtual Hardware\nFor best performance after upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0 from VMware Fusion 1.x, for each virtual machine you need to upgrade its virtual hardware and update with the latest VMware Tools.\nVMware Fusion 2.0 introduces the latest generation of virtual hardware, including improved 3D performance. To upgrade to VMware Fusion 2.0 and update your VMware Fusion 1.x virtual machine to take advantage of the latest changes, see below.\nIMPORTANT: Virtual hardware changes are like upgrading the motherboard of a physical PC. In some cases, Microsoft Windows may ask you to reactivate your copy of Windows. If this is an issue for you, do not upgrade your virtual hardware to the latest version.\nBefore installing VMware Fusion 2.0, launch VMware Fusion 1.x\nResume your virtual machine and shut it down cleanly\nQuit VMware Fusion 1.x\nInstall the VMware Fusion 2.0 upgrade\nLaunch VMware Fusion 2.0, select the virtual machine and choose Upgrade Virtual Machine in the Virtual Machine menu\nStart your virtual machine\nIf the virtual machine was created with VMware Fusion 1.0 (not beta) or later, it should offer to update tools on power on. If not, update VMware Tools manually by going to Update VMware Tools in the Virtual Machine menu\nRestart the virtual machine after tools installation is complete\nLinux Tools\nIn the VMware Fusion DMG download, in order to make the download smaller, we only include pre-compiled Linux kernel modules for a selected number of Linux distributions including all that support Linux Easy Install. Note: Source code is included for Linux Tools in the DMG download, so you can still install VMware Tools for any other supported Linux distribution by installing a C compiler and the Linux kernel headers for your running kernel. For the other Linux distributions, go to http://www.vmware.com/download/fusion/drivers_tools.html to download the Linux Tools ISO that contains pre-built modules for all supported Linux guests.\nThe pre-built modules in the DMG are for:\nMandriva Linux 2008, 2007, 2006\nNovell Linux Desktop 9\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 4, 3\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Desktop 10.3, 10.2, 10.1\nTurbolinux Desktop 10\nTurbolinux Enterprise Server 8\nUbuntu Linux 8.04.1, 8.04, 7.10, 7.04\nTips and Tricks\nTips on using the Mac keyboard\nIf you are unfamiliar with Mac keyboards, the following tips will help you send keystrokes that you know from PC keyboards to virtual machines:\nTo send the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keystroke combination to a virtual machine, do one of the following:\nFrom the Virtual Machine menu, select Send Ctrl-Alt-Delete.\nIf you are using an external PC keyboard, press Ctrl-Alt-Delete.\nOn a full-sized Mac keyboard, press Control-Option-. The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.\nOn a Mac laptop keyboard, press Fn-Ctrl-Option-Delete.\nThe delete key on Apple keyboards is actually the backspace key to all other operating systems. To send the Del key to a virtual machine:\nOn a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-Delete.\nOn a full-sized Mac keyboard, press . The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.\nMac keyboards do not have an obvious Insert key. To send the Insert key to a virtual machine:\nOn a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-M.\nOn a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the Help key.\nMac keyboards do not have a PRINT SCREEN key. To send the PRINT SCREEN key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press F13.\nU.S. Mac keyboards do not have an AltGr key. To send the AltGr key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the right Option key.\nAltGr is supported on European MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards. The Enter key next to the right Command key (otherwise known as the numeric pad Enter key) is remapped to AltGr on Mac laptops.\nBy default, VMware Fusion maps Control-click to a right mouse click. To disable this, go to the menu VMware Fusion > Preferences > Keyboard & Mouse > Mouse Shortcuts and unselect the Control - Primary Button mouse shortcut.\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion\nVMware Tools does not work well with Ubuntu 8.10.\nAlthough VMware Tools can be installed on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 8.10, much of the functionality afforded by VMware Tools does not work. VMware does not recommend using Ubuntu 8.10 as a guest operating system in VMware Fusion 2.0 for now. Future patch releases of VMware Fusion should address these issues\nAccessing Shared Folders might be slow in some instances.\nIn some cases, accessing Shared Folders is slow initially and when entering new folders. This is due to an interaction with Microsoft networking when accessing your Shared Folders using the Desktop shortcut or by navigating to the Shared Folder as a network drive (\\\\.host\\Shared Folders).\nTo work around this Shared Folders pausing issue, map your Shared Folders to a Windows mapped drive letter and only access them using the drive letter. For new virtual machines, VMware Fusion automatically creates this mapped drive letter to Shared Folders for you. In case you don't have this mapped drive letter, do the following to create it:\nOpen the My Computer window, go to the Tools menu and select Map Network Drive\nEnter \\\\.host\\Shared Folders\\ as the Folder and click Finish\nRemove any previous shortcuts to Shared Folders on the desktop and create a new shortcut to the mapped drive letter\nAccessing your Shared Folders as a mapped drive letter should no longer have the long pause you may see by accessing it as a network drive (\\\\.host\\Shared Folders).\nCVSNT and VMware Tools are incompatible. \nThere is a known incompatibility between CVSNT (http://www.cvsnt.org) and VMware Tools. You should uninstall CVSNT if you want to install VMware Tools to use Unity view, and to use cut-copy-paste or drag-and-drop between your virtual machine and your Mac.\nThe McAfee anti-virus ISO remains mounted.\nIf you start the installation of McAfee VirusScan Plus, the McAfee ISO remains mounted, which can lead to two problems.\nIf you cancel the installation and later try to install the bundled anti-virus again, either by clicking Install when the anti-virus prompt appears, or by selecting Virtual Machine > Install McAfee VirusScan Plus, nothing will happen. These commands actually mount the ISO, but leave the launching of the anti-virus installer to the autorun. Because the ISO is already mounted, the autorun is not triggered. To work around this, eject the mounted anti-virus ISO image by selecting Virtual Machine > CD/DVD > Disconnect CD/DVD. Then select Virtual Machine > Install McAfee VirusScan Plus to start the McAfee VirusScan Plus installer again.\nBecause the anti-virus ISO image is occupying the virtual CD/DVD drive, if you insert a CD/DVD on your Mac the CD/DVD will not be mounted in the virtual machine, even if you have set the CD/DVD drive to be attached to the virtual machine. To work around this, go to Virtual Machine > CD/DVD > Use Physical Drive to force mount the disc.\nRunning Google Earth with 3D acceleration enabled can cause the virtual machine to unexpectedly quit. \nTo work around this issue, disable 3D acceleration in the VMware Fusion preferences.\nMac OS X Server virtual machines do not run on 32-bit Mac hardware. \nVMware Fusion does not support OS X Server virtual machines on 32-bit CPUs.\nIn some cases, setting your Mac to \"Mirror Displays\" results in windows not appearing in Unity view. \nIf you set your Mac to mirror displays—for multiple displays or for a TV or projector, for instance—virtual machine windows might not appear properly in Unity view.\nApplication Dock tile disappears in Unity view after a snapshot.\nThe Dock tile for a guest application might disappear if you click on it after you take a snapshot in Unity view. Although the Dock tile disappears as if the application has quit, the application is still running. To restore the Dock tile to the Dock, exit Unity view and reenter.\nVMware Tools are not upgraded in a Windows Me virtual machine. \nIf you power on a Windows Me virtual machine created with VMware Fusion 1.x and attempt to upgrade VMware Tools, the upgrade is not successful, being unable to install certain drivers. It might be necessary to force quit VMware Fusion and restart the virtual machine before you can perform a successful upgrade.\nThe Ubuntu shut down window does not appear in Unity view. \nIf you choose System > Quit in an Ubuntu virtual machine while in Unity view, the shut down window does not appear. To work around this, exit Unity view, press tab until the desired button on the shut down window is chosen and press return.\nDrag and drop stops working in a Linux virtual machine after an alert message.\nIf you encounter an alert message while attempting a drag and drop in a Linux virtual machine, you might have to quit and restart VMware Fusion to get drag-and-drop to work again. This can be the result of a file permission issue, or some other issue, like if you have created a symbolic link, using Terminal, in the Mac and have dragged it to a Linux virtual machine.\nVMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile. \nIf you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.\nResizing a window in a Solaris 10 Update 3 virtual machine might not work in some cases. \nWhen resizing the virtual machine window, the resolution autofits if the window size is smaller than the resolution set during configuration of VMware Tools, but won't autofit if the window size is larger than that resolution. In addition, if you switch the virtual machine to full screen view while its window size is larger than the configured resolution, the display does not expand to cover the entire screen. This problem does not occur with Solaris 10 Update 4.\nDefault applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.\nSetting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.\nVMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.\nIf you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. \nTo work around this problem\nQuit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp\nDelete Boot Camp\nRestart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition\nQuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view. \nOccasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen.\nDownloading files with Safari in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might fail when using NAT as networking type. \nUsing NAT as networking type for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might result in Safari downloads timing out. This is a bug in Safari. This does not happen with scp or curl. Workaround: For downloading in Safari, select Bridged for your networking type to connect directly to the physical network. Choose Virtual Machine > Settings, select Network, and select Bridged on the Network panel.\nViewports are not updated in 3ds Max 2009.\nViewports do not display or refresh properly. To prevent this problem, do the following.\nOpen 3ds Max, go to Customize > Preferences > Viewports > Configure Driver\nDeselect Use Incremental Scene Updates and click OK.\nDisable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nHaving a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.\nDo not enter Unity view if the User Account Control confirmation window is displayed. \nIn a Microsoft Vista virtual machine, do not enter Unity view while the User Account Control (UAC) confirmation window is open. If you do, the resolution does not adjust correctly and your windows will be able only to move within an area as big as the virtual machine window before entering Unity view. The workaround is to exit and reenter Unity view.\nIf a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.\nIf you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.\nSometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application.\nThere are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating \"file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest.\" VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.\nA guest operating system with four vCPUs cannot be reset from the Virtual Machine menu.\nUsing Reset from the Virtual Machine menu to reset a guest operating system with four vCPUs can result in an alert stating the virtual machine cannot be powered on. If this occurs, simply power on the virtual machine again. (This issue does not affect Windows and Linux guests for which VMware Tools have been installed.)\nSome Linux applications do not start from a virtual machine's Applications menu.\nWhen in Unity view on a Linux guest you might not be able to start some applications from a virtual machine's Applications menu on the host. For some applications, the application might show a fatal error at startup and for others, the application does not start.\nWorkaround: Do one of the following:\nOn Open SUSE guests, use a text editor to open the file named /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.common. Search for and delete the block of lines starting with Beginning of the block added by the VMware software and ending with End of the block added by the VMware software.\nOn Debian and Ubuntu guests, find and delete the file named /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99-vmware-vmware_user (or similar).\nIf you are using xdm, use a text editor to open the files named xdm-config in /etc/X11/xdm, /usr/lib/X11/xdm, /usr/local/lib/X11/xdm, and so on. Search for and delete the block of lines starting with Beginning of the block added by the VMware software and ending with End of the block added by the VMware software.\nMoving the menu bar to another display while using multiple displays in Full Screen view might result in the virtual machine window going blank.\nWhen you are using very large topologies, greater than 4096 x 4096, changing the location of the menu bar from one display to another can stop the virtual machine window from being rendered. Switching to Single Window view and back enables the virtual machine to recover, as can doing a suspend and resume of the guest.\nGuest operating system does not change to fit resized virtual machine window.\nOn Windows 95 and Windows 98 guests, resizing the virtual machine's window does not cause the guest operating system to adjust its resolution to fit unless you use the guest's Display Properties settings to change the screen resolution to a higher value than 640 X 480.\nUsing \"Safely Remove Hardware\" for an HID USB device sometimes results in disconnecting the USB Controller. \nIn some cases, using the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the Windows taskbar's notification area to disconnect a USB device can cause the entire USB Controller and all other devices attached to that USB Controller to be removed. This applies only to bootable HIDs (usually mice, keyboards, and tablets)—other USB devices can be disconnected with Safely Remove Hardware. \nIf this happens, shut down your virtual machine, go to the USB panel of the Virtual Machine settings window and configure the virtual machine to add back the removed controller.\nManually connect USB devices when you use Unity view. \nThe Automatically connect USB Devices setting does not apply to a virtual machine in Unity view, by design. To connect a USB device to a virtual machine in Unity view, choose Virtual Machine > USB in the VMware Fusion menu for that virtual machine, and choose the USB device to connect.\nWorking offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.\nUsing mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.\nWorkaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.\nIn certain cases, unmirroring \"My Music\" will not work after upgrading to the release version of VMware Fusion 2 from a Beta 2 or RC version.\nThis does not happen for anyone installing VMware Fusion 2.0 for the first time. In certain cases with a Windows XP virtual machine running in VMware Fusion 2.0 after it has been upgraded to the release version, deselecting Music in Mirrored Folders on the Sharing window does not prevent the My Music folder being shared with the Mac. To fix this you must change a value in User Shared Folder in the guest.\nWorkaround:\nIn the virtual machine, select Run from the start menu.\nRun regedit.\nGo to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders\nChange the \"My Music\" value from \\\\.host\\Shared Folders\\My Music to %USERPROFILE\\My Documents\\My Music (this varies by language and is only true for Windows XP)\nLog out of the guest and log back in.\nWith a shared file, moving or copying it to its existing location by a different path can cause data loss.\nIf a file is located in a shared or mirrored folder, and you move or copy it to the same location but accessed through a different path, this results in the file being lost. An example of where this could happen is if the Desktop is mirrored at the same time as the Mac home folder is shared, and you attempt to move or copy a file from the desktop to the shared home folder/Desktop directory. This causes the file to overwrite itself with garbage content. Because of this potential problem, VMware Fusion attempts to disable shared folders that create this risk. If a shared folder is automatically disabled, do not re-enable it unless you know what you're doing. Drag-and-drop is also disabled for files that are located in shared or mirrored folders. Moving, copying, or dragging and dropping files that are not located in shared or mirrored folders is not affected by this problem.\n3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: \"DirectX error message . . .\"\nIf the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.\nMac OS X bug causes Mac to lock up under heavy I/O activity. \nIn some cases your Mac can become unresponsive after heavy I/O activity. This is an acknowledged Apple bug; Apple plans to include the fix in Mac OS X 10.5.5.\nInstall Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.\nOversaturated colors in Age of Empires III.\nIn Age of Empires III on a virtual machine, the colors of certain elements in the window might be oversaturated, in some cases going to white.\nTo work around this problem:\nIn Age of Empires III, choose Help & Tools > Option > Graphics Options\nDeselect Bloom Effect and click OK\nPrinting cannot be enabled if the virtual machine has more than one serial port configured already.\nIf you have already added two or more serial ports to a virtual machine, you cannot enable a printer on the Printers panel of the VMware Fusion Settings window.\nInstall Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.\nDo not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine hangs during auto update of Tools.\nWhen powering on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine that was created in a previous version of VMware Fusion, it is possible for the virtual machine to hang while in the middle of the tools auto upgrade process. If you encounter this issue please shut down the virtual machine and power it back on. The virtual machine should boot without problems the second time. At this point uninstall and then reinstall tools to ensure that they function properly.\nThe Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server. In some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.\nThe first boot of a newly imported Windows 2000 virtual machine can take a long time.\nPart of the process of booting up a newly imported virtual machine entails finding new hardware. This takes a long time on a Windows 2000 virtual machine, and the dialogs that relate to this process are obscured by the Tools installer dialog. This can result in the user thinking the installer is stuck when it is not. All subsequent boots of the virtual machine proceed at a normal pace.\nTrying to browse Microsoft Windows Network (WINS) while in NAT mode might result in an error message.\nPossible error messages include \"The specified network is no longer available\" and \"The semaphore timeout period has expired.\" The workaround is to go to the Network panel in System Preferences on the Mac and delete and recreate your Location. This issue does not arise in Bridged mode.\nVMDKMounter does not mount partitioned dynamic disk VMDK.\nVMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.\nVMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.\nTo add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.\nIf you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.\nDragging an RTF file from the guest to Microsoft Word 2008 in the host causes the Word application to close unexpectedly.\nAvoid dragging and dropping RTF files onto Word in the host. If you drag the file onto Word again after restarting the application, however, the file will be able to be opened.\nLogging in after having turned off mirroring for the Desktop folder when logged off produces an alert.\nThis happens if you have logged out of the current user account while mirrored Desktop was enabled, but then turned off mirroring for the Desktop while logged out. Changing the setting results, when logging back in, in an alert saying the location of the folder can't be found. When you click OK, however, the settings are fixed and things will work as expected.\nIncorrect security flaw message appears when you do something with shared folders.\nIn Windows XP with certain versions of Internet Explorer 6, you might see a \"This page has an unspecified potential security flaw\" message when you navigate between certain shared folders or drag and drop a file or folder onto a mirrored folder. The correct dialog box for these instances should contain a \"copy/move from this zone\" query. Internet Explorer 7 fixes this problem, so the recommendation is to upgrade to it.\nDefault browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.\nIn certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.\nThe VMware Fusion menu bar in Full Screen view might stop responding after you choose Help.\nIn certain cases, the VMware Fusion menu bar might cease to work in Full Screen view. This happens if you choose Help. Use the keyboard shortcut Control-Command-Return to exit Full Screen view, after which you can return to Full Screen view with the menu working. You can also use Command-Tab to switch to another application, after which the VMware Fusion menu becomes responsive although still in Full Screen view.\nInternet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host.\nIf you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, \"Protected Mode\" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\\\.host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.\nWorkaround:\nOpen Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.\nClick the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).\nClick Sites, then Advanced, type \\\\.host and click Add, then Close and OK.\nBack in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.\nClick OK, and accept the warning, \"The current security settings will put your computer at risk,\" by clicking OK again.\nClose Internet Explorer to apply the change.\nInternet Explorer will now open files from \\\\.host correctly.\nA designated shared application does not launch in a powered off virtual machine.\nIf a virtual machine is powered off and it contains an application used by other virtual machines or the host as the designated shared application for opening files or URLs, when you open one of those files or URLs, the virtual machine will resume, but the application will not launch automatically. However, once the virtual machine is running, trying to open the files or URLs again works.\nCannot drag and drop a file directly to the host from a network drive in Ubuntu.\nIn Ubuntu 7.04 and Ubuntu 7.10, you can't drag and drop a file directly from a network drive in your virtual machine to your Mac. The workaround is to drop the file on your Ubuntu desktop, then drag and drop it to the Mac.\nShared Folders permissions might be too restrictive in Linux and Mac OS X Server guests.\nThese problems might consist of not getting write access, or getting an \"access denied\" message. The uid and gid of the guest needs to match that of the host. You get the uid of your Mac host by opening Terminal and running id. \nWorkaround for Linux: Edit the /etc/fstab entry for the shared folder and add uid=XXX,gid=YYY to the options column, where XXX and YYY are the uid and gid to be used for the guest user.\nWorkaround for Mac OS X Server:\nGo to /Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/services.sh\nModify the line mount -t vmhgfs .host:/ '/Volumes/Shared Folders' to look like\nmount -t vmhgfs -o uid=<XXX> .host:/ '/Volumes/Shared Folders' \nwhere XXX is the uid to be used for the guest user.\nRun sudo '/Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/services.sh' --restart\nCannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected.\nHaving a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.\nCannot run an executable if it is in a shared folder in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine.\nSome games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.\nImporting a Boot Camp partition for the first time can result in it getting stuck in the processing stage the first time you start it up.\nVMware Fusion allows you to import your Boot Camp partition into an independent virtual machine that no longer relies on the Boot Camp partition itself. However, if you import the Boot Camp partition and immediately run the Boot Camp partition itself as a virtual machine, the Boot Camp partition can become stuck in the \"preparing\" phase. If this happens, force quit Fusion, restart your Mac, and restart Fusion. The Boot Camp partition can then be run as a virtual machine, will prompt for your password, and preprocessing will complete in a timely fashion.\nFlat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.\nVMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.\nReconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.\nSome virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time.\" If you get this error, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.\nEnabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.\nSelecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.\nOverlapping windows have redraw issues in Exposé.\nOverlapping windows in Exposé have redraw issues with only the top most non-overlapping windows showing correctly.\nFor networking to work properly in your virtual machines, reboot your Mac after upgrading its operating system, or after using the Migration Assistant.\nAfter upgrading from Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) to Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), you must to reboot your Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion. Similarly, after using Apple's Migration Assistant to move your data and applications from one Mac to another, you will need to reboot the new Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion.\nConflict in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) between VMware Fusion and anti-virus software can cause memory corruption.\nRunning a virtual machine in VMware Fusion creates a .vmem file either inside the virtual machine's package, or in /tmp/vmware-. If you are running Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger), and the Norton AntiVirus' Auto-Protect feature scans the .vmem file while the virtual machine is running, host memory corruption can occur. The problem described here has been reproduced with Norton AntiVirus, but it is possible that the problem could occur with other anti-virus or backup software as well.\nUpgrade to Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) to avoid this problem altogether.\nTo prevent this conflict from occurring in Mac OS X 10.4, exclude both the Virtual Machines folder and the /tmp/vmware-<YourUserName> folder from the Norton AntiVirus SafeZones (System Preferences > Norton Auto-Protect > Safe Zones > Everywhere EXCEPT in).\nA typical symptom of this problem is that when you try to suspend the virtual machine, it gets stuck, and VMware Fusion can no longer run virtual machines. To recover from that situation:\nShut down the host operating system as soon as possible and restart it.\nPrevent the conflict from occurring as described above.\nDiscard the .vmss file for the affected virtual machine. Note: Whatever state was saved in the last suspend is lost.\nBoot up the virtual machine.\nNo audio can be heard in virtual machines created with some very old guest operating systems.\nOld operating systems, such as DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95, may not have drivers for the virtual ES1371 sound device that Fusion presents. Other VMware products optionally present a Sound Blaster 16 device for these guests, but Fusion does not have this capability. This clarification also applies to previous versions of VMware Fusion.\nCreating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 might fail if there is insufficient memory.\nBefore creating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 as its guest operating system, ensure that you have enough memory assigned to the virtual machine to complete the process. You need 490MB and an additional 50MB for each NIC. For instance, if you were creating a virtual machine with two NICs, you would need to assign a minimum of 590MB to have a successful virtual machine creation.\nTurbolinux 10 Server does not reboot automatically after installation in a virtual machine.\nAt the end of the installation of Turbolinux 10 Server in a virtual machine, when you click Finish the system does not reboot and the screen becomes black. This results from a problem Turbolinux has switching from X to VGA. Workaround: Press the Enter key to continue with the reboot.\nMicrosoft Money 2006 does not update financial information over the internet if its data file is stored on a Shared Folder.\nThis problem does not occur with Microsoft Money 2008. For Microsoft Money 2006, there are two workarounds: 1) Store the Microsoft Money file in the virtual disk of the virtual machine; or 2) Enable Windows File Sharing on your Mac's System Preferences, share the folder that contains your Microsoft Money data file, and mount the Mac's network share in the virtual machine to access it.\nUsing the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.\nIf this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.\nTo help VMware better understand what happens in this case, please file a support incident that includes your Boot Camp logs. The logs can be found in your home folder as the file\n~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Helper/naos-1.0.vmwarevm/vmware.log\nPlease note that the folder naos-1.0.vmwarevm is a package. If you are opening it with Finder, right-click the icon and select Show Package Contents.\nApplications that use Multiple Document Interface (MDI), such as Microsoft Excel, might not display correctly in Unity view.\nUnity view is not supported when more than one user is logged in to Windows. \nFast User Switching is not compatible with Unity view.\nWhen you cancel a drag-and-drop operation between the Mac host and a virtual machine, it may take several seconds before another drag-and-drop operation is possible. \nThe virtual machine guest operating system can require several seconds to cancel a drag-and-drop operation. When you attempt a drag-and-drop operation, a plus sign (+) should appear on the file or folder you are dragging and dropping. If the plus sign does not appear, the virtual machine could be processing a prior operation. Wait a few seconds and try again.\nIn virtual machines running Linux distributions with kernel versions lower than 2.4, VMware Fusion does not support drag and drop operations between the virtual machine and the host.\nIf you are installing Microsoft Windows Vista from multiple installation disks, Windows Easy Install does not work.\nTo install Vista from multiple installation disks, use the standard installation: in the New Virtual Machine Assistant, when the Windows Easy Install panel is displayed, deselect Use Easy Install and click Continue to proceed with the standard installation.\nPowering on multiple virtual machines (whose combined memory allocation exceeds that of the host physical system) can slow the system.\nIf the memory allocated to running virtual machines approaches or exceeds the physical memory available on the host, the system can become very slow. This can happen with one or more virtual machines running. Make sure to only power on virtual machines that have memory allocations that your host machine can handle. If you encounter this problem, close one or more virtual machines. You might also consider reducing the memory allocation of some of your virtual machines (Virtual Machine > Settings > System Hardware > Memory).\nOn Macs with more than one CD-ROM drive (internal or external), physical CD-ROM drives cannot be moved between running virtual machines.\nThis occurs when two or more virtual machines are powered on, and one of the physical CD-ROM drive is connected to one of the powered-on virtual machines. If you disconnect the physical CD-ROM drive from the virtual machine, and then attempt to connect the CD-ROM drive to one of the other powered-on virtual machines, the connection fails.\nTo work around this problem, reset the virtual machines.\nVirtual machines stored on drives formatted with FAT32 may crash in VMware Fusion.\nThis problem is accompanied by the error message: Argument list too long.\nTesting suggests that this problem may indicate a corrupted disk.\nMigrating Linux virtual machines between Intel and AMD hosts. \nVMware recommends you do not migrate a Linux virtual machine between hosts when one host is running on an AMD processor and the other is running on an Intel processor.\nDuring installation, many distributions of Linux choose a kernel that is optimized for the specific processor on which it is being installed, and some distributions install a generic kernel by default, but provide architecture-specific kernels that the user can choose to install. The kernel might contain instructions that are available only on that processor. These instructions can have adverse effects when run on a host with the wrong type of processor.\nFor 64-bit SUSE Linux versions lower than 10.1, VMware virtual machines support the X graphical windows system only if you have installed VMware Tools in the virtual machine.\nFixing sound problems in virtual machines running Vista 32-bit edition \nWhen you install Microsoft Vista 32-bit edition in a VMware Fusion virtual machine, there is no sound output. To correct this problem, run Windows Update to update the sound driver from within Vista. \nTo update the sound driver in a VMware Fusion virtual machine running Windows Vista 32-bit edition:\nIn the virtual machine, from the Windows start menu, right-click Computer and select Properties.\nIn the left pane, under Tasks, select Device Manager.\nWhen prompted for your permission to continue, click Continue.\nWindows displays the Device Manager.\nRight-click the Multimedia Sound Adapter with a warning symbol (indicating that there is no driver) and select Update Driver Software.\nAt the prompt How do you want to search for driver software?, select Search automatically for updated driver software. \nWindows finds and installs the appropriate driver for your virtual sound card.\nWhen you are prompted to restart, click Restart Now.\nSound should now work in your Microsoft Vista 32-bit virtual machine.\nSound does not work in virtual machines running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2. \nTo enable sound in a virtual machine running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2, you must enable the Windows Audio Service: open the Sounds and Audio Devices Control Panel. Windows prompts you to enable the audio device. When you enable the device, Windows reboots. Sound should now work in the virtual machine.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Build 116369 is a release build of VMware Fusion.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Build 116369 is a release build of VMware Fusion."},{"entry":"The release notes contain the following:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"The release notes contain the following:"},{"entry":"What's New in VMware Fusion 2.0","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New in VMware Fusion 2.0"},{"entry":"Other VMware Fusion 2.0 Documentation","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Other VMware Fusion 2.0 Documentation"},{"entry":"System Requirements for VMware Fusion","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"System Requirements for VMware Fusion"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Installation Notes","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Installation Notes"},{"entry":"Tips and Tricks","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tips and Tricks"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0 is a Free Upgrade for All VMware Fusion 1 Customers","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"VMware Fusion 2.0 is a Free Upgrade for All VMware Fusion 1 Customers"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion 2.0 is available free to owners of VMware Fusion 1","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"2.0","ReleaseDate":"27/10/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"VMware Fusion 2.0 is available free to owners of VMware Fusion 1"},{"entry":"All existing virtual machines created with VMware Fusion 1 are fully supported in VMware Fusion 2.

{"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ReleaseContents":"Build 94249 is a release build of VMware Fusion.\nThe release notes contain the following:\nKey Features of VMware Fusion\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.3\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.2\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.1\nWhat's New in VMware Fusion 1.1\nGaming with VMware Fusion\nDownload VMware Fusion and Virtual Machines\nBefore You Begin\nTips and Tricks\nUsing Unity View\nKnown Issues\nKey Features of VMware Fusion\nVMware Fusion is a desktop application that lets you create and run virtual machines on your Intel-based Mac. VMware's first product for the new Intel Macs makes it easier than ever to take advantage of the security, flexibility, and portability of virtual machines. VMware Fusion provides an intuitive user interface for creating virtual machines, and for running preconfigured virtual machines created with VMware Workstation, VMware Server, and ESX Server. With VMware Fusion, you can run your favorite Windows applications on your Mac. You can also download virtual machines from the VMware Technology Network (VMTN) Web site, which has a growing library of virtual appliances with a wide range of pre-installed and preconfigured applications and operating systems.\nFeatures of VMware Fusion:\nYou can use 32-bit and 64-bit guest operating systems in VMware Fusion virtual machines. VMware Fusion supports Windows, Linux, and Solaris operating systems in virtual machines.\nYour virtual machines can have multiple virtual processors, taking advantage of the Intel Core Duo chips in today's newest Intel Macs.\nVMware Fusion supports high-speed USB 2.0 for a huge range of devices. Even devices that do not have drivers for Mac OS X will work in a virtual machine.\nVirtual machines seamlessly integrate with your Mac: you can cut and paste text between your Mac and your virtual machines, drag and drop files, and create shared folders on your computer so you can easily share files and folders.\nUnity view displays your Windows virtual machine applications directly on your Mac desktop. The virtual machine window is hidden, and your virtual machine applications are displayed in the Mac dock, so you can use them just as you use your native Mac applications. See Using Unity View.\nYou can burn CDs or DVDs to your Mac's rewritable optical drive from within your virtual machine.\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.3\nVMware Fusion 1.1.3 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a variety of issues.\nVMware Fusion 1.1.3:\nCorrects a problem in which VMware Fusion encountered reactivation problems in the native Boot Camp partition and the Boot Camp virtual machine when installing Windows Vista SP1.\nFixes a problem in VMware Fusion 1.1.2 that caused HGFS mounting failures in Linux guest operating systems.\nFixes a problem where VMware Fusion did not distinguish between Traditional and Simplified Chinese so that if your system language preference was set to either Chinese version, Fusion would present the Simplified Chinese interface. In verison 1.1.3, Fusion differentiates between the two Chinese systems and enables the user to specify another language as a preference if Traditional Chinese is not available.\nUpdates the Simplified Chinese on-line help.\nCorrects a problem in which a virtual machine originally created with a product other than Fusion got the error \"Cannot connect virtual device sound\" when it tried to play a sound.\nVMware Fusion 1.1.1 incorporated a workaround for Apple bug 5679432 (Mac OS X hang under heavy disk load when unbuffered I/O is in use). That version of Fusion disabled unbuffered disk I/O on Mac OS X 10.5 hosts, even if the user selected Optimize for Mac OS application performance in VMware Fusion preferences. Apple fixed this bug in Mac OS X 10.5.3, so VMware Fusion 1.1.3 removes the workaround when the guest operating system is Mac OS X 10.5.3 or higher.\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.2\nVMware Fusion 1.1.2 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a variety of issues.\nVMware Fusion 1.1.2:\nCorrects a problem in which the remapping of keyboard shortcuts in Full Screen or Single Window view could not be disabled. Deselecting Enable Mac OS keyboard shortcuts now works as expected.\nFixes a problem that could arise when the user attempted to run a virtual machine with the virtual CD drive connected but without a drive connected to the Mac. This problem was most likely to happen on a MacBook Air. The virtual machine no longer fails in this situation.\nAdds support for Windows XP SP3 when importing a Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.\nFixes a problem that prevented the user from being able to burn CDs with a USB Superdrive on the MacBook Air.\nFixes a problem that caused VMware Fusion to fail when the user pressed some newly introduced keys on the new slim Apple keyboard, if the Enable debugging checks preference was set.\nCorrects a problem in which VMware Fusion occasionally would not return a USB device to Mac OS control when a virtual machine was shut down. VMware Fusion now makes sure to disconnect the device from the virtual machine, making it available to the Mac.\nFixes a compatibility problem with wireless bridging and DHCP/routing behavior that could prevent a virtual machine from getting an IP address in certain cases.\nCorrects a sound problem in which only the default speaker worked in certain cases.\nIn some cases, VMware Fusion, after being upgraded to Version 1.1.1, would fail with a Signal 10 error when the user tried to use the keyboard. This problem has been fixed.\nVirtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) no longer causes memory corruption. Version 1.1.2 contains a fix for the problem described in security advisory VMSA-2008-0005.html, section i.\nVMware Fusion 1.1.2 and Mac OS X Leopard Time Machine Issue Resolved\nA bug in the Mac OS X 10.5-10.5.1 operating systems caused the system to fail if Time Machine attempted to back up live virtual machines. To avoid this, VMware Fusion 1.1 excluded all virtual machines from Time Machine backups. Apple resolved the Time Machine bug in Mac OS X 10.5.2, so VMware Fusion 1.1.2 now allows Time Machine backups of virtual machines if the Mac is running Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher. This may result in larger Time Machine backups. If the backups are now too large, you can manually exclude your virtual machines from Time Machine backup and copy them separately to your backup disk.\nIssues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.1\nVMware Fusion 1.1.1 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a variety of issues.\nVMware Fusion now transparently remaps keyboard shortcuts when the user goes back and forth between applications in the guest and in the host. For example, VMware Fusion remaps -X to Ctrl-X in the guest. The same remapping happens for -Z/-C/-V/-P/-A/-F.\nThe number pad Enter key on European keyboards is always treated as AltGr. NumLock no longer disables this feature.\nThis release fixes host and guest connectivity problems that could arise when using wireless networking.\nVMware Fusion 1.1 contained a fix so that suspending a virtual machine located in a FileVault folder no longer makes the system unresponsive. The problem reappeared with Mac OS X 10.5.x (Leopard), and this release fixes it in this version of the OS as well.\nPrint jobs sent from the guest to a Kodak AiO 5100 series printer are now successful.\nWhen the user starts up a Boot Camp virtual machine, the password prompt now has focus, so that the user can type in the password without first having to move the mouse over the dialog box to select it.\nA problem causing the application to hang at launch, and for which the workaround was to delete the plist, has been fixed in this release.\nIn some instances users with Mac OS X 10.5.0 and 10.5.1 could get a soreceive corrupted . . . kernel panic. Version 1.1.1 fixes this problem.\nVersion 1.1.1 corrects a problem in which VMware Fusion was producing an error message when a user attempted to enable promiscuous mode for an Ethernet adapter in Mac OS X 10.5.\nThe SRS iWOW plugin no longer breaks the sound in VMware Fusion.\nThis release fixes a problem with the internal microphone when VMware Fusion runs on Mac OS X 10.5.\nVersion 1.1.1 corrects a caps lock LED synchronization problem that could lead to a kernel panic in vmioplug.\nThis release fixes problems with using the mouse after installing VMware Tools on a Ubuntu 7.10 guest.\nThis release fixes a problem that resulted in a hang when certain volumes were accessed from an HGFS share.\nHaving a Digidesign CoreAudio plugin no longer causes a bouncing vmx icon to appear in the Dock with a \"Not Responding\" label in Activity Monitor.\nIn some cases, a VMware virtual machine would not recognize a hardware breakpoint set in an application and would not stop the code execution. This problem has been fixed.\nSome Mac OS X bugs affect VMware Fusion 1.1.1.\nAs a workaround for Apple bug 5679432 (Mac OS X hang under heavy disk load when unbuffered I/O is in use), VMware Fusion 1.1.1 disables unbuffered disk I/O on Mac OS X 10.5 hosts, even when the user selects Optimize for Mac OS application performance in VMware Fusion preferences.\nA bug in the operating system would, in some cases, result in all applications running with root privileges following a upgrade to Mac OS X 10.5.1, instead of how the user originally set them. This would prevent VMware Fusion from reading its own files. This has been reported to Apple to be addressed in a future release.\nWhat's New in VMware Fusion 1.1\nNew and Improved Features in VMware Fusion 1.1\nVMware Fusion 1.1 has more than 25 enhancements, including:\nSupport for Mac OS X 10.5 \"Leopard\"\nAccess to even more Windows 3-D applications and games, with experimental support for DirectX 9.0 accelerated 3-D graphics (without \"shaders\")\nEnglish, French, German, and Japanese versions all in the same download\nImprovements to Unity in VMware Fusion 1.1 that makes Microsoft Windows on the Mac even more seamless with:\nSupport for Windows Vista 32- and 64-bit editions\nSupport for Windows XP 64-bit edition\nMy Computer, My Document, My Network Places, Control Panel, Run, and Search are now available in the Applications menu, Dock applications menus, and the Launch Applications window\nOption to show/hide the Windows taskbar and Startmenu in the VMware Fusion View menu\nVMware Fusion Launch Applications window now appears only when you choose\nImproved performance when resizing and dragging windows in Unity view\nBoot Camp integration even better with VMware Fusion 1.1:\nUse Microsoft Vista Boot Camp partitions in VMware Fusion virtual machines\nAutomatic remount of Boot Camp partition after Boot Camp virtual machine is shut down\nImproved support for detecting and preparing Boot Camp partitions for use as virtual machines\nOther improvements:\nAbility to sync iPhone with Outlook in Windows virtual machines\nEject key now ejects the optical drive when attached to a virtual machine\nVMware Shared Folders created with Windows Easy Install now defaults to Read-Only access of the Mac's home directory for maximum security>\nOption to hide the VMware Fusion status bar, to take advantage of more screen real estate\nInstallation status and \"out of date\" status for VMware Tools is made more obvious on the status bar\nNecessity to power off a virtual machine to modify virtual hardware setting is made more obvious\nBugs Fixed in VMware Fusion 1.1\nVMware Fusion 1.1 includes the following improvements and bug fixes:\nIntel VT is now correctly enabled on 64-bit Intel Macs when powering on or resuming a virtual machine after the Mac is put to sleep or awakened\nFixed issue where VMware Fusion would use more memory over time\nResolved issue where windows would freeze in certain cases in Unity view\nImproved DNS resolution when using NAT networking\nFixed issue where Caps Lock mapping preference would always be reset after using VMware Fusion 1.1 Beta\nRestored ability to shrink virtual disks lost after using VMware Fusion 1.1 Beta\nIn addition to the improvements listed above, this release fixes numerous bugs to greatly improve the stability of VMware Fusion.\nGaming with VMware Fusion\nVMware Fusion now has experimental support for DirectX 9.0 3-D graphics (without shader support) to enable more Microsoft Windows 3-D applications and games to run. This will allow for many new games to run in VMware Fusion that could not be previously run. However, if a game requires shaders it may not run at all. Games that provide the ability to run without shaders can potentially run in VMware Fusion 1.1.\nVMware Fusion does not support 3-D acceleration in Unity view. For 3-D applications, use Single Window or Full Screen view.\nCustomizing the virtual machine's mouse settings for playing games \nMost games require some custom mouse settings to work correctly. These settings lock the mouse to the virtual machine when you are running a game. Note: These settings will affect the acceleration setting of the mouse, and disable the ability to automatically move the mouse between the virtual machine and your Mac. The setting in the user's preference file will also prevent the use of the drag-and-drop feature from all virtual machines to the host machine. Remove the settings to revert back to default behavior.\nTo customize the virtual machine's mouse settings for playing games, use TextEdit to make the following changes while the virtual machine is powered off:\nIn the virtual machine directory, add the following line to the end of the virtual machine's configuration (.vmx) file:\nvmmouse.present = \"FALSE\"\nIn your home directory, add the following line to the end of the file ~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/preferences:\npref.motionUngrab = \"FALSE\"\nThese configuration settings do not take effect until you shut down the virtual machine, quit VMware Fusion, and then restart VMware Fusion and the virtual machine.\nNote: The configuration file setting vmmouse.present = \"FALSE\" and the preference file setting pref.motionUngrab = \"FALSE\" are incompatible with Unity view. To use Unity view, change the configuration file settings for vmmouse.present and pref.motionUngrab to \"TRUE\" or delete the lines from the configuration file.\nAlso Note: When you edit a virtual machine's configuration (.vmx) file, if you copy and paste text from a browser into the file using TextEdit, VMware Fusion might be unable to open the resulting .vmx file, because some applications (like Firefox) add legacy Mac characters (carriage returns) at the end of each line. This release of VMware Fusion requires Mac OS X characters (line feeds) at the end of each line, and cannot understand legacy Mac characters. To work around this problem, convert the legacy end-of-line characters in the .vmx file to Mac OS X end-of-line characters:\nOpen Terminal from /Applications/Utilities.\nType\nnano \"~/Virtual Machines/vm-dir/vm-name.vmx\" \nwhere vm-dir and vm-name are the path and name of your .vmx file, and press Enter.\nWhen nano loads, type Control-O, and press Enter. This converts the legacy end-of-line characters to Mac OS X end-of-line characters.\nType Control-X to exit.\nDownload VMware Fusion and Virtual Machines\nYou can download VMware Fusion and obtain a serial number at\nwww.vmware.com/vmwarestore/buyfusion.html.\nYou can download a Getting Started Guide for VMware Fusion at \nwww.vmware.com/pdf/fusion_getting_started_11.pdf.\nYou can download virtual machines to use with VMware Fusion at\nwww.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/.\nBefore You Begin\nInstall antivirus software in Windows virtual machines before you connect networking.\nConnecting a Windows virtual machine to a network exposes the virtual machine to any active viruses present in the network. VMware recommends that you install antivirus software in any Windows virtual machine before you connect networking. Note that VMware Fusion's default network connection type for new virtual machines is NAT, which will prevent the spread of viruses over the network into the virtual machine, and will only expose the virtual machine to external viruses through browser security flaws when you browse the Internet.\nTips and Tricks\nTips on using the Mac keyboard\nIf you are unfamiliar with Mac keyboards, the following tips will help you send keystrokes that you know from PC keyboards to virtual machines:\nTo send the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keystroke combination to a virtual machine, do one of the following:\nFrom the Virtual Machine menu, select Send Ctrl-Alt-Delete.\nIf you are using an external PC keyboard, press Ctrl-Alt-Delete.\nOn a full-sized Mac keyboard, press Control-Option-. The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.\nOn a Mac laptop keyboard, press Fn-Ctrl-Option-Delete.\nThe delete key on Apple keyboards is actually the backspace key to all other operating systems. To send the Del key to a virtual machine:\nOn a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-Delete.\nOn a full-sized Mac keyboard, press . The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.\nMac keyboards do not have an obvious Insert key. To send the Insert key to a virtual machine:\nOn a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-M.\nOn a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the Help key.\nMac keyboards do not have a PRINT SCREEN key. To send the PRINT SCREEN key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press F13.\nU.S. Mac keyboards do not have an AltGr key. To send the AltGr key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the right Option key.\nAltGr is supported on European MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards. The Enter key next to the right Command key (otherwise known as the numeric pad Enter key) is remapped to AltGr on Mac laptops.\nUsing Unity view\nUnity view works only after you install the latest version of VMware Tools in the virtual machine and reboot. \nFor this version of VMware Fusion, if you do not reboot the virtual machine after installing VMware Tools, the Applications menu might not be populated.\nNote the following known issues with VMware Fusion support of Unity view in Microsoft Windows Vista virtual machines:\nThe Start button always appears in the bottom left corners of the main monitor.\nThe Windows background shows through the Windows Sidebar. For the best experience, VMware recommends that you disable the Windows Sidebar when you use Unity view.\nKnown Issues with VMware Fusion\nFor networking to work properly in your virtual machines, reboot your Mac after upgrading its operating system, or after using the Migration Assistant.\nAfter upgrading from Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) to Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), you must to reboot your Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion. Similarly, after using Apple's Migration Assistant to move your data and applications from one Mac to another, you will need to reboot the new Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion.\nUnity view in VMware Fusion can disrupt the operation of Spaces virtual desktops in Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).\nIf you are running VMware Fusion in Unity view in one space but working in another space, the appearance of a popup window (for instance, an Outlook calendar event reminder) in the VMware Fusion virtual machine can cause Spaces to jump back and forth between the two virtual desktops.\nConflict in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) between VMware Fusion and anti-virus software can cause memory corruption.\nRunning a virtual machine in VMware Fusion creates a .vmem file either inside the virtual machine's package, or in /tmp/vmware-. If you are running Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger), and the Norton AntiVirus' Auto-Protect feature scans the .vmem file while the virtual machine is running, host memory corruption can occur. The problem described here has been reproduced with Norton AntiVirus, but it is possible that the problem could occur with other anti-virus or backup software as well.\nUpgrade to Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) to avoid this problem altogether.\nTo prevent this conflict from occurring in Mac OS X 10.4, exclude both the Virtual Machines folder and the /tmp/vmware-<YourUserName> folder from the Norton AntiVirus SafeZones (System Preferences > Norton Auto-Protect > Safe Zones > Everywhere EXCEPT in).\nA typical symptom of this problem is that when you try to suspend the virtual machine, it gets stuck, and VMware Fusion can no longer run virtual machines. To recover from that situation:\nShut down the host operating system as soon as possible and restart it.\nPrevent the conflict from occurring as described above.\nDiscard the .vmss file for the affected virtual machine. Note: Whatever state was saved in the last suspend is lost.\nBoot up the virtual machine.\nMicrosoft Windows sometimes fails when you attempt to run the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.\nIn some cases, attempting to run your Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine might result in Windows failing. If this happens, editing the Boot Camp virtual machine .vmx file might possibly fix the problem. One thing to try is to open the .vmx file and delete the line that reads\nscsi0.present = \"TRUE\".\nTo find the .vmx file for the Boot Camp virtual machine, go to the virtual machine's package at\n<your home folder>/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp/<disk identifier>/Boot Camp partition.vmwarevm.\nRight-click on the package, choose Show Package Contents, and open the .vmx file shown in the package.\nEvery time the virtual machine tries to play a sound it gets the error \"Cannot connect virtual device sound\"\nIn rare instances with certain virtual machines originally created with a product other than Fusion, the virtual machine gets this error and is unable to play sound each time it powers on and each time it tries to play a sound. To work around this problem, power off the virtual machine, remove the sound device by going to Settings and clicking the Remove Sound Device button in the Sound pane, and re-add it by clicking the button (now labeled Add Sound Device) again.\nSome Applications menu items do not work if VMware Tools has not been updated.\nIf you run a Microsoft Windows virtual machine in VMware Fusion 1.1 with VMware Tools installed from version 1.0, the Applications menu items My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, Control Panel, and Run do not work. Upgrade VMware Tools to fix this problem.\nEasy Install of a Vista guest operating system fails if the user name on the Mac is Administrator.\nIf you create a virtual machine in this manner, it cannot be logged into because it acts as if no valid user was created. Trying to log in as administrator results in a message saying the account has been disabled.\nTo avoid this problem when you create a virtual machine: in the Windows Easy Install panel of the New Virtual Machine Assistant, change the entry in the Name field from the default entry Administrator. \nIf you have already created the virtual machine with Administrator entered in the Name field on the Windows Easy Install panel, take the following steps to work around the problem:\nStart the virtual machine in safe mode by pressing F8 during the boot.\nOnce the virtual machine is booted in safe mode, Vista permits you to log on to the system as administrator, which it does not permit in non-safe mode.\nIn start > run type manage.\nExpand the local users and groups area, and select users.\nSelect administrator in the right pane.\nChoose action > properties.\nDeselect Disable this account in the General tab.\nCannot select anything on the guest desktop with the mouse when in Unity view if you select Show the Desktop from the Taskbar.\nTo recover from this problem, do one of the following:\nSelect any of the Unity windows, which are minimized to the dock in this situation.\nUse Alt-Tab to select a window in the guest.\nUse the Applications menu to launch an application.\nChanges to the shared folder settings might not take effect.\nWhen you make changes in the settings window to the Shared Folders window, sometimes the changes will not take effect. To ensure that the changes you make actually happen, use the Apply button rather then the OK button. If the changes you made did not properly take effect, please repeat them and click Apply.\nNote: The check box that indicates the shared folders feature is enabled can only become enabled when the virtual machine is powered on. The enabled check box to permit access to a specific shared folder can be enabled and disabled at any time.\nNo audio can be heard in virtual machines created with some very old guest operating systems.\nOld operating systems, such as DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95, may not have drivers for the virtual ES1371 sound device that Fusion presents. Other VMware products optionally present a Sound Blaster 16 device for these guests, but Fusion does not have this capability. This clarification also applies to previous versions of VMware Fusion.\nThe Mac stops responding or experiences a kernel panic if you run two virtual machines on a RAID 0 disk.\nRAID 0 volumes are not a tested configuration for VMware Fusion 1.1. Work is in progress on this problem.\nInstalling VMware Tools in Fusion for a virtual machine created in Japanese Workstation 6 might cause the installer to fail.\nIn Fusion, if you open a virtual machine created in Japanese Workstation 6 and try to install VMware Tools, the installation might fail with an error message.\nWorkaround: Uninstall the tools from within the virtual machine and then install the Fusion 1.1 tools.\nOpen the virtual machine.\nChoose Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools to display the VMware Tools wizard.\nSelect Remove, and click Next and Remove.\nChoose Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools to go to the VMware Tools wizard and install a fresh version of VMware Tools.\nIn new virtual machines, the VMware Shared Folders shortcut is not created on certain French or Japanese Windows desktops.\nOrdinarily, when creating a new virtual machine, VMware Fusion creates a shared folders shortcut on the guest operating system desktop. However, in the case of virtual machines created with French or Japanese Microsoft Windows XP Pro SP2 as the guest operating system, this does not occur.\nWorkaround: Create your own shortcut.\nOpen the Explorer.\nType \\\\.host in the Address field.\nPress Enter.\nRight-click on the Shared Folders icon.\nChoose Create a Shortcut.\nClick Yes to the message Windows cannot create a shortcut here. Do you want the shortcut to be placed on the desktop instead?\nA shortcut to Shared Folders is now available to the user on the French or Japanese Windows XP virtual machine.\nCreating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 might fail if there is insufficient memory.\nBefore creating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 as its guest operating system, ensure that you have enough memory assigned to the virtual machine to complete the process. You need 490MB and an additional 50MB for each NIC. For instance, if you were creating a virtual machine with two NICs, you would need to assign a minimum of 590MB to have a successful virtual machine creation.\nTurbolinux 10 Server does not reboot automatically after installation in a virtual machine.\nAt the end of the installation of Turbolinux 10 Server in a virtual machine, when you click Finish the system does not reboot and the screen becomes black. This results from a problem Turbolinux has switching from X to VGA. Workaround: Press the Enter key to continue with the reboot.\nAfter upgrading to VMware Fusion 1.1, 3-D works only after you install the latest version of VMware Tools in the virtual machine and reboot.\nIf you do not install the latest version of VMware Tools, which updates the SVGA driver, 3-D will not work in the virtual machine. To get 3-D to work, go to the Virtual Machine menu and choose Install VMware Tools. Reboot the virtual machine.\nNote: This also applies when reverting to a snapshot taken from an earlier version of VMware Fusion before the upgrade to version 1.1. 3-D will not work, and you must update VMware Tools and reboot the virtual machine.\nUsing the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.\nIf this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.\nTo help VMware better understand what happens in this case, please file a support incident that includes your Boot Camp logs. The logs can be found in your home folder as the file\n~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Helper/naos-1.0.vmwarevm/vmware.log\nPlease note that the folder naos-1.0.vmwarevm is a package. If you are opening it with Finder, right-click the icon and select Show Package Contents.\nWhen you use the Mac dock to launch an application from a powered-off virtual machine, VMware Fusion does not always successfully restore the virtual machine to Unity view.\nIn this situation, the dock can incorrectly indicate that an application is running, even though the virtual machine is in Single Window view. After you power off the virtual machine, the dock continues to incorrectly show that the application is running. To work around this problem, Control-click or right-click the application icon in the dock, and select Quit. This problem has been observed frequently on Mac Minis, and less frequently on Macbook Pros.\nChanging the host Mac resolution while a virtual machine is in Unity view causes mouse and display problems. \nIn virtual machines running in Unity view, if you change the host Mac to a display resolution higher or lower than the resolution of the virtual machine, the mouse can become inoperable or the display can become corrupted. To avoid this problem, do not change the host Mac resolution while a virtual machine is in Unity view.\nPlugging in or unplugging an external display while a virtual machine is in Unity view causes display problems. \nIn virtual machines running in Unity view, if you plug in or unplug an external display, the display can become corrupted and cause the Unity windows to disappear. To avoid this problem, do not plug in or unplug an external display while a virtual machine is in Unity view.\nOn dual-monitor host systems, when you switch from Unity view to Full Screen view, virtual machines displayed on the secondary monitor do not have the correct screen resolution.\nTo work around this problem, switch to Single Window view, and then switch to Full Screen view.\nWhen you copy or move a virtual machine to a new location, the virtual machine does not retain information from the original virtual machine about applications displayed in the Mac dock in Unity view. \nTo work around this problem, delete the Applications folder from the copied or moved virtual machine:\nPower off the virtual machine.\nControl-click or right-click the virtual machine in the Finder and select Show Package Contents.\nLocate the Applications folder, move this folder to the Trash, and empty the Trash.\nPower on the virtual machine.\nSome file systems, such as FAT and UFS, are unable to support very large files. \nIf you are creating a virtual machine that will be used in a hard drive with a file system that does not support very large files, select the New Virtual Machine Assistant option Split disk into 2GB files. This option is in Advanced disk options, in the Virtual Hard Disk panel of the New Virtual Machine Assistant.\nApplications that use Multiple Document Interface (MDI), such as Microsoft Excel, might not display correctly in Unity view.\nIn Unity view, VMware Fusion does not support multiple monitors. \nAll virtual machine windows displayed in Unity view must be in a single-monitor display.\nWhen a virtual machine application is displayed in Unity view, quitting the application from the Mac dock does not work. \nFor this release, in Unity view, when you Control-click or right-click a virtual machine application in the dock and select Quit, the application icon is removed from the dock, but the application itself continues to run.\nUnity view is not supported when more than one user is logged in to Windows. \nFast User Switching is not compatible with Unity view.\nIn Windows virtual machines, if you uninstall the VMware pointing device driver, and then Control-click or right-click to select an option from an application displayed in Unity view, the virtual machine might quit unexpectedly.\nThis problem can occur if you uninstall the VMware pointing device in My Computer > Properties > Hardware > Device Manager, and then, in a virtual machine application window displayed in Unity view, Control-click or right-click and select any option, for example, Properties.\nSwitching to Unity view while a snapshot operation is in progress may result in unpredictable display behavior.\nDo not switch views while a snapshot operation is in progress. To recover from this situation, switch to Single Window view and then back to Unity view.\nWhen you cancel a drag-and-drop operation between the Mac host and a virtual machine, it may take several seconds before another drag-and-drop operation is possible. \nThe virtual machine guest operating system can require several seconds to cancel a drag-and-drop operation. When you attempt a drag-and-drop operation, a plus sign (+) should appear on the file or folder you are dragging and dropping. If the plus sign does not appear, the virtual machine could be processing a prior operation. Wait a few seconds and try again.\nIn rare circumstances, a virtual machine can fail to detect any bootable CD in the CD/DVD drive, including the Windows XP installation CD.\nTo work around this problem, try the following:\nIn the virtual machine, open Virtual Machine > Settings > Removable Devices > CD/DVD.\nChange the setting from Automatically detect physical CD/DVD drive to Specify physical CD/DVD drive, and select cdrom0.\nClick OK.\nIf the antivirus software Alwil avast! 4.7 is installed in a virtual machine, when you access VMware Fusion shared folders through a Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path (rather than through a mapped drive letter) it can cause Windows Explorer to become unresponsive or quit unexpectedly. \nTo work around this problem, access VMware Fusion Shared Folders through a mapped drive letter and not through a UNC path. You could also use a different antivirus program: this problem has not been observed with other antivirus programs.\nIf the antivirus software Alwil avast! 4.7 is installed in a virtual machine, the virtual machine might become unresponsive when you open a document from a VMware Fusion Shared Folder with permissions set to read/write. \nTo work around this problem, move the document from the VMware Fusion Shared Folder to a local folder in the virtual machine. You could also use a different antivirus program: this problem has not been observed with other antivirus programs.\nIf the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file contains the line monitor = \"debug\", deselecting the option Diagnostics: Enable debugging checks has no effect.\nTo work around this problem, open the virtual machine configuration file in a text editor and remove the line monitor = \"debug\".\nFiles in DivX digital media format versions higher than 6.3 do not display correctly in Windows Media Player in VMware Fusion virtual machines. \nTo work around this problem:\nWith Windows Media Player open, click the down-facing triangle in the upper right of the Windows Media Player window to display the applications menus, and choose Tools > Options.\nIn the Options window, select the Performance tab, and click Advanced.\nDeselect the option Use video mixing renderer.\nPowering on a virtual machine within a host window that has a scrollbar might cause the virtual machine to respond to mouse input incorrectly or incompletely.\nTo work around this problem, click the host window's scrollbar to scroll the display up or down.\nIn virtual machines running Linux distributions with kernel versions lower than 2.4, VMware Fusion does not support drag and drop operations between the virtual machine and the host.\nThe VMware Fusion BIOS posts too quickly to access. \nMost users will not need to access the BIOS, but advanced users might want to do so, to change the boot order, set a boot password, or enable a second floppy drive. To work around this problem, use a text editor to add the following line to the configuration (.vmx) file of the virtual machine:\nbios.forceSetupOnce = \"TRUE\"\nThe next time you boot up the virtual machine, it will automatically boot into the BIOS. This configuration option then reverts to FALSE. You must set the option to TRUE each time you want to boot the virtual machine into the BIOS.\nIf you are installing Microsoft Windows Vista from multiple installation disks, Windows Easy Install does not work.\nTo install Vista from multiple installation disks, use the standard installation: in the New Virtual Machine Assistant, when the Windows Easy Install panel is displayed, deselect Use Easy Install and click Continue to proceed with the standard installation.\nIn virtual machines running on Macs with two monitors, each with its own video card, if you run a 3-D application with 3-D acceleration enabled, VMware Fusion fails with an ASSERT.\nVMware Fusion does not support 3-D acceleration for this configuration. If your Mac has two monitors, each with its own video card, do not enable 3-D acceleration.\nPowering on multiple virtual machines (whose combined memory allocation exceeds that of the host physical system) can slow the system.\nIf the memory allocated to running virtual machines approaches or exceeds the physical memory available on the host, the system can become very slow. This can happen with one or more virtual machines running. Make sure to only power on virtual machines that have memory allocations that your host machine can handle. If you encounter this problem, close one or more virtual machines. You might also consider reducing the memory allocation of some of your virtual machines (Virtual Machine > Settings > System Hardware > Memory).\nUsing iSight in Mac OS X versions lower than 10.4.8 after using it in a virtual machine might require shutting down and restarting the host machine.\nVMware Fusion does not support Mac OS X versions lower than 10.4.8. After disconnecting the built-in iSight camera from a Windows XP virtual machine, you might experience issues with corrupted video when using the camera in Mac OS X versions 10.4.7 and lower.\nIf this occurs, shut down your host machine and turn it back on to reset your iSight camera. Rebooting is not sufficient to completely reset the iSight camera. To avoid this problem, upgrade your Mac OS X system software to version 10.4.9 or higher.\nOn Macs with more than one CD-ROM drive (internal or external), physical CD-ROM drives cannot be moved between running virtual machines.\nThis occurs when two or more virtual machines are powered on, and one of the physical CD-ROM drive is connected to one of the powered-on virtual machines. If you disconnect the physical CD-ROM drive from the virtual machine, and then attempt to connect the CD-ROM drive to one of the other powered-on virtual machines, the connection fails.\nTo work around this problem, reset the virtual machines.\nGuests with extremely high display resolutions (2360 x 1770) may display as a solid white screen.\nThis issue might occur with a Mac mini or Macbook. To work around this problem, set the display in the guest to a lower resolution.\nVirtual machines stored on drives formatted with FAT32 may crash in VMware Fusion.\nThis problem is accompanied by the error message: Argument list too long.\nTesting suggests that this problem may indicate a corrupted disk.\nMigrating Linux virtual machines between Intel and AMD hosts. \nVMware recommends you do not migrate a Linux virtual machine between hosts when one host is running on an AMD processor and the other is running on an Intel processor.\nDuring installation, many distributions of Linux choose a kernel that is optimized for the specific processor on which it is being installed, and some distributions install a generic kernel by default, but provide architecture-specific kernels that the user can choose to install. The kernel might contain instructions that are available only on that processor. These instructions can have adverse effects when run on a host with the wrong type of processor.\nFor 64-bit SUSE Linux versions lower than 10.1, VMware virtual machines support the X graphical windows system only if you have installed VMware Tools in the virtual machine.\nFixing sound problems in virtual machines running Vista 32-bit edition \nWhen you install Microsoft Vista 32-bit edition in a VMware Fusion virtual machine, there is no sound output. To correct this problem, run Windows Update to update the sound driver from within Vista. \nTo update the sound driver in a VMware Fusion virtual machine running Windows Vista 32-bit edition:\nIn the virtual machine, from the Windows start menu, right-click Computer and select Properties.\nIn the left pane, under Tasks, select Device Manager.\nWhen prompted for your permission to continue, click Continue.\nWindows displays the Device Manager.\nRight-click the Multimedia Sound Adapter with a warning symbol (indicating that there is no driver) and select Update Driver Software.\nAt the prompt How do you want to search for driver software?, select Search automatically for updated driver software. \nWindows finds and installs the appropriate driver for your virtual sound card.\nWhen you are prompted to restart, click Restart Now.\nSound should now work in your Microsoft Vista 32-bit virtual machine.\nSound does not work in virtual machines running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2. \nTo enable sound in a virtual machine running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2, you must enable the Windows Audio Service: open the Sounds and Audio Devices Control Panel. Windows prompts you to enable the audio device. When you enable the device, Windows reboots. Sound should now work in the virtual machine.\n","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Build 94249 is a release build of VMware Fusion.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Build 94249 is a release build of VMware Fusion."},{"entry":"The release notes contain the following:","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"The release notes contain the following:"},{"entry":"Key Features of VMware Fusion","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Key Features of VMware Fusion"},{"entry":"Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.3","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.3"},{"entry":"Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.2","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.2"},{"entry":"Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.1","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.1"},{"entry":"What's New in VMware Fusion 1.1","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"What's New in VMware Fusion 1.1"},{"entry":"Gaming with VMware Fusion","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Gaming with VMware Fusion"},{"entry":"Download VMware Fusion and Virtual Machines","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Download VMware Fusion and Virtual Machines"},{"entry":"Before You Begin","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Before You Begin"},{"entry":"Tips and Tricks","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tips and Tricks"},{"entry":"Using Unity View","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Using Unity View"},{"entry":"Known Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Known Issues"},{"entry":"Key Features of VMware Fusion","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"1.1.3","ReleaseDate":"30/05/2008","ApplicationName":"VMWare Fusion","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Key Features of VMware Fusion"},{"entry":"VMware Fusion is a desktop application that lets you create and run virtual machines on your Intel-based Mac.
