{"VersionNumber":"7.0.12","ReleaseDate":"11/01/2013","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nThis release includes an important security patch for Tableau Server version 7.0 and higher. The patch addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails code, an open source web development framework that is a component of the Tableau Server architecture.\nTableau strongly recommends upgrading to Tableau Server version 7.0.12 as soon as possible. For a detailed description of the vulnerabilities, see the Ruby on Rails website: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org\nAdded support for the modulo operator (%) in calculated field formulas for the following data sources: DB2, Firebird, Generic ODBC, SAP Hana, Cloudera Hadoop, InterSystems Cache, MySQL, Netezza, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Teradata, VectorWise, and Vertica.\nAdded support in Tableau Server for Aster Database Release 5.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nUsing filled maps and fields with table calculations could cause the error \"The query results are missing a tuple required for computing totals.\" This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connected to Microsoft SQL Server, converting a text column to the FLOAT data type using a calculated field would sometimes result in an error message and other times not depending on the fields used in the view. This issue has been corrected and Tableau now returns the error message consistently when the conversion fails.\nSome dashboards that connect to Oracle data sources would load slower in version 7.0.4 and later than they did in previous versions. Performance improvements were made so these dashboards are no longer slower.\nManual sort order and groups would be discarded after closing and reopening a workbook even after saving. This issue occurred when connecting to Microsoft SQL Server data sources that have a collation that is different than the column collation. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connecting to Oracle databases, Tableau now correctly returns private synonyms as items that can be included in a connection.\nImproved performance for some workbooks that contained a large number of table calculations. The workbooks could take several minutes to save. Saving these workbooks now takes less time.\nWhen using the generic ODBC connector to connect to DB2 databases, joining multiple tables would sometimes fail and the OK button in the dialog box would be inactive. This issue was caused by failing discovery queries. This issue has been corrected by turning on a CAP_SUPPRESS_DISCOVERY_QUERIES flag.\nThe find field search box in the Data window would sometimes lose the first character typed in as the search string. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application would sometimes unexpectedly exit due to a field that was no longer part of the data source was still incorrectly included in a filter. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connecting to data using a Custom SQL connection, the CAP_SUPPRESS_DISCOVERY_QUERIES property was not being completely followed and discovery queries were still issued incorrectly. This issue has been corrected.\nWorkbooks that connect to Microsoft SQL Server databases that have DATETIME2 fields that were saved on a machine with SQL Server 2012 drivers would cause an error when opening the workbook on a machine that has the SQL Server 2008R2 drivers installed. This issue has been corrected. If you connect to a data source using DATETIME2, Tableau now sets a minimum-driver-version attribute in the workbook connection. When opening the workbook any driver that satisfies that minimum requirement will work. If your driver does not meet the minimum requirement you will get an error message.\nConnecting to Oracle Essbase cubes where the Essbase server returns invalid metadata values would cause Tableau Desktop to unexpectedly exit. This has been corrected and Tableau now ignores the invalid metadata.\nMap labels for Edo State in Nigeria were mislabeled as Ekpomo. This issue has been corrected.\nCustom Value filter searches now have similar results returned from search strings between Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. Prior to this change there were different behaviors with respect to the handling of wildcard characters. Both products now follow the behavior of: 1) Searching for color* returns strings that begin with \"color\"; 2) Searching for *color returns strings that end with \"color\"; 3) Searching for *color* returns strings with \"color\" appearing anywhere in the string; 4) Searching for color with no wildcards is treated as if it were *color*.\nTableau Server\nCorrected an issue where memory allocation wasn't handled correctly, resulting in Tableau Server shutting down unexpectedly.\nWorkbooks published with more than 5,000 filters wouldn't display when viewed in a mobile browser. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a security issue related to URL redirection.\nCorrected an issue on Tableau Mobile where views would sometimes not open, displaying the error \"A server with the specified hostname could not be found.\"\nViews would sometimes show an error with no error details. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau Server versions that had migrated from version 6.x to 7.0.3 or higher sometimes experienced problems importing users from a CSV file, assigning workbook permissions, and editing data connections. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau servers configured for high availability with replicated data engine components would leave behind large temporary files after the replication process. These files sometimes consumed large amounts of disk space. Temporary files are now properly cleaned up after a sync.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.12","ReleaseDate":"11/01/2013","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"This release includes an important security patch for Tableau Server version 7.0 and higher.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.10","ReleaseDate":"04/12/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nAdded the -t, --tempdir [path] option for the tabadmin backup command. This option allows you to specify the directory used for temp files created during the backup.\nOptions were added to the tabcmd export command to specify the width and height of the page. Use 'tabcmd help export' to see the syntax for the new options.\nAdded support for Progress OpenEdge 11.1.\nAdded Support for Vectorwise 2.5.\nAdded support for Hortonworks.\nAdded support for DataStax.\nAdded support for Cloudera Impala (beta).\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nViews would incorrectly become invalid (grayed out) when both a set and a field contained within that set were added to the same shelf. This issue has been corrected and in most cases adding both the set and the field result in a valid view.\nFor non-Asian languages, the calculations dialog box now uses the Courier New font in order to provide the best balance of readability.\nImplemented a performance optimization when using large grouped fields while connected to Vertica databases, version 5.1 and later.\nCorrected an issue where reference lines for totals would not appear in views with two continuous axes when one axis was a continuous date.\nWhen connecting to Oracle databases, Tableau now correctly returns private synonyms as items that can be included in a connection.\nCorrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when working with complex dashboards.\nWhen connected to Oracle databases, using the DATENAME function to retrieve day names now uses the Oracle FMDay function instead of the Oracle Day function. The Oracle Day function would add trailing spaces to the returned names (e.g., \"Monday\" would be returned as \"Monday \") because the function returned strings at the precise length of the longest word. Using these results would cause Tableau comparisons to fail. The DATENAME function now works as expected and returns just the day name without the trailing spaces.\nWhen using Teradata Query Bands and editing the connection to delete a previously defined query band statement, the delete would not always succeed and the statement was not actually removed from the connection. This issue has been corrected and a deleted query band statement stays deleted.\nWhen connected to a DB2 database, version 9.7 or later, using datetime fields defined as TIMESTAMP_ISO data types would cause the DB2 error 'SQL0583N The use of routine \"SYSFUN.TIMESTAMP_ISO\" is invalid because it is not deterministic or has an external action.' This issue has been corrected.\nImplemented several changes to allow connecting to 1010data databases using an ODBC connection. This connection requires the use of a Tableau data source customization (.tdc) file, which the 1010data technical team can assist with.\nConnections to OData data sources that include Top N limits where the N is a number evenly divisible by 100 would fail (i.e. 100, 200, 300 would fail while 99 or 101 would succeed). This issue has been corrected.\nUsing ODBC to connect to multiple tables in a SAS data source could cause the error 'Driver does not support this function.' This issue has been corrected.\nTableau Server\nSetting both page size and page orientation when exporting PDF files was not scaling the output properly. This issue has been corrected.\nWildcard searches on the Data Connections page, which are those that include an * in the search string, could result in search errors such as 'An error occurred while searching' and 'Ill-formed regular expression'. This issue has been corrected.\nDate formats on Range of Date quick filters were not being correctly retained when a workbook was published to Tableau Server. This has been corrected and Server will now retain Desktop formatting.\nCorrected an issue where exporting views as PDF, PNG, or CSV could cause the error 'Tableau Server encountered an internal error. Request ID: ... could not obtain a database connection within 10 seconds. The max pool size is currently 10; consider increasing it.'\nViews on a dashboard that had page shelves set to synchronize were calculating which page to show based on the page number in the view, rather than on the value of the page shelf data. This issue has been corrected so that the page shown is based on the synchronized value.\nThe administrative view, Most Accessed Views, was only accounting for views in the Default site. It now correctly accounts for views in all sites.\nImplemented a performance optimization when working with Extracts and the Data Server. This optimization caches metadata that workbooks retrieve from the extract. In some scenarios, caching this metadata provides a substantial performance improvement.\nCookies returned from Tableau Server when using trusted tickets were incorrectly using a 24-hour time representation, using 1-24 when 0-23 is the correct representation. The use of 24 (the midnight hour) was causing problems for some .NET applications.\nUsing the tabadmin stop command would generate an incorrect error \"ERROR:Could not shutdown 'Tableau Server Repository' using a command line\" in the Windows event log. Changes were implemented to prevent the incorrect error from being logged.\nCorrected an issue in the Tableau Android application that could prevent it from connecting to Tableau Server.\nThe \"Remember me\" check box on the server login page sometimes had no effect. This issue has been corrected.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.10","ReleaseDate":"04/12/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Added the -t, --tempdir [path] option for the tabadmin backup command.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.9","ReleaseDate":"25/10/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nTableau is now available in Korean and Simplified Chinese. In Desktop, select Help > Choose Language to change to the Korean or Chinese display. On Server, click your username at the top of the page and select a new language on the Language drop-down menu.\nAdded support for connecting to SAP Hana databases.\nTableau now supports connections to Cloudera CDH3u4 and CDH4.\nAdded support for connecting to Cloudera Hadoop Hive data sources using either Beeswax server only to increase concurrency or Beeswax server and Kerberos to increase concurrency and security. These options are now available during connection when using the Cloudera CDH3u4 driver and may require additional configuration of your cluster.\nAdded support for United States Congressional Districts to the built-in geocoding. You can now map this type of information by selecting the Congressional District geographic role. U.S. Congressional District boundaries are determined by data provided by each state's redistricting commission.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nOptimized queries to Microsoft SQL Server tables where columns defined as INT data types were sometimes queried in a way that was missing the index.\nWhen connecting to SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW) data sources, using the Wildcard quick filter mode could sometimes cause an \"Invalid MDX command\" database error. This issue has been corrected and these filters no longer cause an error.\nWhen connecting to a Teradata database, joining two tables that have same name that differ only by case could cause a \"Command text was not set for the command object\" error. Tableau was not accounting for the case sensitivity correctly. This issue has been corrected and Tableau now correctly handles the table names and creates the join.\nWhen adding support for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese characters in the calculated field dialog box, the default font was changed. However, the new font did not properly support all of the characters across these languages. This dialog box now selects a font based on the Workbook Language. For example, if the workbook language is set to Korean, then all Korean characters are supported. However, Chinese characters may not display correctly until the workbook language is changed to Chinese.\nIncreased the default \"rows to fetch\" size for Greenplum connections from 100 to 10,000. This change can improve query performance by minimizing the number of distinct calls needed to return a large number of records.\nWhen using the Measure Names field to color marks based on two instances of the same measure, the default color encoding was saved regardless of changes to the color legend. Saving and reopening the workbook would revert to the default colors. This issue has been corrected.\nChanging the sort order of the members of a set manually would not always save correctly if the members contained special characters (e.g., parenthesis). This issue has been corrected and the special characters are now being handled so the sort order is retained.\nA \"Large Publish Warning\" message would sometimes occur when publishing a workbook with a live connection to a large external file. The warning would display even when the \"Include External Files\" check box was cleared. This issue no longer occurs and these workbooks are published without warning.\nIn previous versions, it could sometimes take a long time to enumerate schemas for Oracle connections. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem in Version 7.0.8 in which the Calculated Fields dialog box font was smaller than in earlier versions.\nTableau Server\nPreviously, when a data source field name contained a backslash (\\) character, Tableau Server rejected requests to update filters that depended on the field. An error message would display saying that the server could not respond due to a malformed request. This issue has been corrected.\nEmbedding and then resizing a fixed size view in Internet Explorer version 8.0 sometimes resulted in a blank page being loaded instead of the view. This issue has been corrected.\nWorkbooks based on MSAS data sources would sometimes fail to load and an \"Analysis Services database error\" would display. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem in which the tabcmd syncgroup command would not always correctly import or remove users from Tableau Server.\nPreviously, sizing a dashboard to an extremely small height using Internet Explorer version 8.0 on Windows 7 or Windows XP would cause the web browser to become unresponsive. This issue no longer occurs.\nUsing the \"Download all rows as a text file\" option to export data in a CSV file sometimes had an encoding problem and all fields were exported as one column. This encoding issue has been corrected.\nIncremental extract refreshes would fail if they followed a purge of backgrounder tasks. This was because the purge removed a directory necessary for the extract refreshes to complete. This issue has been corrected.\nPDF files generated from tabcmd export are now sized correctly.\nTableau Server usernames and passwords could not be updated with the tabcmd createusers or createsiteusers commands, even though the output indicated that the update occurred. This issue has been corrected.\nFilters added via the URL were sometimes not applied.

These maps will display according to your workbook language setting (Help > Choose Language). You may need to clear the map tile cache in order for the new maps to display. You can clear the cache by opening Internet Explorer and deleting your browse history in the Internet Options.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nTableau's handling of large binary data over ODBC connections sometimes resulted in \"Out of memory\" errors. Improvements were made to memory usage for this type of data.\nCorrected how fractional seconds in columns defined as datetime datatypes were handled for ODBC connections. Tableau was handling fractional seconds as a fractional value rather than matching the ODBC specification and treating the fractional seconds as billionths of a second. Treating the data as a fractional value could lead to dates being reported incorrectly when fractional times were used. In conjunction with this change, the CAP_ODBC_FETCH_IGNORE_FRACTIONAL_SECONDS customization option was added, which will instruct Tableau to discard fractional seconds for ODBC sources that don't correctly handled the fractions as billionths of a second. Refer to Customizing and Tuning ODBC Connections to learn more.\nDisabled the option to change a background image defined in a data source that was created by \"Creating a Local Copy\" of a Tableau Server data source. Background images in this scenario were meant to be part of the definition inherited from the Server.\nConnecting to SAS using an ODBC connection could cause a \"Driver does not support this function error.\" In this case, the error was related to the driver not support foreign key detection.\nCreating an extract from an extract data source that was published to Tableau Server, could cause the error \"No details available.\" This error occurred when the Tableau Server data source contained an aggregate calculation. This issue has been corrected.\nCommas were difficult to distinguish when writing formulas in the Calculated Field dialog box. When Japanese support was added, the font used in this dialog box was changed to support Japanese characters. The font is now dependent on the workbook language.\nTableau Server\nThe view data page now displays in the correct language based on the language preference you set on your Tableau Server account page rather than always using the browser language.\nConnections to Tableau Server data sources (i.e., data sources that are published to the data server) now optimize queries by selecting which tables to include in the FROM clause. This optimization is often referred to as join culling and excludes tables that will not impact the results returned. This change can often make queries run significantly faster. This optimization only affects connections to data sources that are published to Tableau Server.\nOptimized performance for the tabadmin start command when the server uses a core license or when high availability is configured.\nUsing tabcmd to publish workbooks with hidden sheets would publish all the sheets including the hidden ones. This issue has been corrected.\nOn dashboards, action filters set to \"Exclude all values\" for the target sheet was not working correctly. This issue has been corrected.\nCombining both the --publisher and --license options when using tabcmd syncgroup or tabcmd addusers commands would not set the publisher role. Instead, you would have to run two separate commands. This issue has been corrected and you can now use both options on a single command.\nWorkbooks and data sources sometimes failed to download if Tableau Server was installed using a lower case drive letter. This issue has been corrected.\nRelative date filters displayed on a view with a dark background now correctly shows the relative date selection as black text on a white background. Previously, the filter would show as white text on a white background and would not be readable.\nCorrected an issue where unexpected values would be selected after searching in a quick filter.\nFixed a problem with URL actions not performing correctly in Internet Explorer v8.0.\nLoading a view sometimes resulted in the following error message \"Unknown SessionID class std::out_of_range\". This issue has been corrected.\nA background process would sometimes fail in high availability clusters and the following message would display: \"Name has already been taken.\" This issue has been corrected.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.8","ReleaseDate":"20/09/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Spanish and Portuguese maps are now available.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.7","ReleaseDate":"07/08/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nTableau is now available in Japanese. In Desktop, select Help > Choose Language to change to the Japanese display. On Server, click your username at the top of the page and select Japanese in the Language drop-down menu.\nAdded support for connecting to Microsoft PowerPivot 2012.\nAdded support for connecting to MapR Hadoop distributions.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nWhen connected to a MySQL database, creating a group from a calculated field would result in empty values until the data was extracted. This issue has been corrected and these groups now display the correct values with a live connection to the database.\nThe built-in geocoding now recognizes \"Ft\" as a synonym for \"Fort\" to match places such as \"Ft Lauderdale\" and \"Ft Worth.\"\nCorrected how the built-in geocoding represents the Moscow region and urban area.\nAdjusted how double-clicking zooms on maps to correct occasional inconsistencies.\nWhen connected to a multidimensional data source, the Edit Locations dialog box would show the full field name instead of the values (e.g., \"[customer].[state]\" instead of \"British Columbia\"). This issue has been corrected.\nSaving and reopening a workbook that has reference lines based on parameters would reset the reference line to use the axis field instead. This issue has been corrected.\nRefreshing all extracts in a workbook would fail if some of the data sources required a username and password. Tableau now prompts for the necessary authentication before refreshing these extracts.\nImproved performance when working with date fields in a DB2 database. DATE fields are no longer wrapped with the TIMESTAMP_ISO function. This change does not affect DATETIME fields.\nThe application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when removing a field from the Size shelf after hiding the size legend. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where using a reference line based on a parameter could cause a \"Schema:GetIndex\" error.\nCorrected an issue where attempting to print from Tableau could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nWhen connecting to Oracle databases, corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit if the account logging into Oracle does not have access to the Oracle V$VERSION Oracle system object. Tableau uses the V$VERSION system object to determine the Oracle version number. Without access to this object, the application cannot connect. In these cases, the application now displays an error message instead of exiting.\nInserting the \"Data Update Time\" into a title or caption would show the UTC time when connected to an extract data source. This issue has been corrected and the local time is now shown.\nWhen connected to an Excel workbook, the application could sometimes unexpectedly exit when modifying the Fiscal Year Start for a date dimension. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application could unexpectedly exit when connecting to an OData data source that has a field with a one-to-many relationship. The application no longer exits in this case.\nWhen connected to an SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW) database, quick filters for measures did not always display correctly. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connected to a Tableau Server data source, adding a context filter could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nOptimized indexing for temporary tables that the application generates when filtering dimensions. Ensuring that these tables are indexed improves performance.\nWhen performing scheduled extract refreshes using workbooks that include Initial SQL, the scheduled tasks were not correctly identified as failed if the initial SQL failed. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau Server\nThe tabcmd export command was not properly creating output files (PDF or CSV) when filter or parameter values were specified. This issue has been corrected.\nIf you have unlicensed machines running VizQL servers in the cluster, you could get the error, 'Fatal Exception in vizql engine.' The unlicensed state is now detected as the cause and a, 'No license found; Session creation failed' message is returned instead.\nIn a distributed environment, downloading workbooks from a site that is not the default would cause intermittent download errors. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected some problems with syncing non-Latin usernames (including Hebrew and Czech) from Active Directory.\nOpening views using Mobile Safari would not always scale the view to the full width of the iPad, leaving a gap on the right side of the page. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where invalid date values in a CSV file (e.g., a date with a year value that is 7 digits long) would cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nWhen embedding views the _http_requests audit table was not setting the user_id value. This issue has been corrected and the username is now properly set in the _http_requests table for embedded views.\nUsing the Data Connections page to update the connection properties for multiple connections in a single workbook could result in the error, 'Attempted to update a stale object: Workbook.' This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue where navigating to the Site page to add a user would show an empty page.\nFiltering the list of views or workbooks by date would result in no workbooks showing if the server was installed in a timezone east of GMT. This issue has been corrected.\nUsing tabcmd to export PDF files would fail if automatic login was enabled on the server. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen using filter actions in dashboards actions could stop functioning if the workbook was configured to show sheets as tabs and it was published to a non-default site. This issue has been corrected.\nOptimized performance for adding users using the 'tabcmd addusers' command.\nCorrected an issue where Active Directory groups that have zero members that were imported into a version 6.1 server would prevent that server from successfully upgrading to 7.0.\nNames in Hebrew were not properly displayed in the /users page on Tableau Server. This issue has been corrected.\nThe server was not correctly prompting for a password when viewing a workbook that connects to IBM DB2 databases using the ODBC (generic) connection type. Instead it was displaying a security processing error. This case is now handled properly and a more relevant error message is provided when incorrect credentials are provided.\nAdditional Considerations\nWhen using Tableau Desktop or Server in Japanese, the built-in maps will display in English. To use the Japanese maps, download the Online.tms file shown below and copy it into the directory where you installed Tableau (see examples below). This extra step will NOT be necessary in future versions of Tableau.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.7","ReleaseDate":"07/08/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Tableau is now available in Japanese.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.6","ReleaseDate":"02/07/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nTableau for Android is now available. The Tableau application is available in the Google Play Store. Tableau Server also supports the Android web browser.\nAdded support for ParAccel 3.5 and later.\nAdded support for DATETRUNC, DATEPART, DATEPART, DATEADD, and DATEDIFF functions when connecting to ParAccel 3.5 or later.\nAdded a Repeat Map option to the Map Options card. When this option is selected, the map and corresponding marks will be repeated in the far East and West of the map area. The Repeat Map opiton is off by default.\nAdded functionality so that wgserver session IDs appear for some Tableau Server events in the Windows Event logs, thus allowing administrators to correlate Tableau Server Event log entries with data in the Server Activity administrative view. To see the data, from a tooltip in the Server Activity view, click View Data, then select the Underlying tab. Scroll to the right to see the session_id column.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nPrint to PDF options (e.g., paper size and orientation) were not saved each time a PDF was generated. This issue has been corrected and the settings are now saved.\nAdded Kosovo state names to built-in geocoding.\nImproved performance when connecting to ParAccel 3.5 and later by no longer creating temporary tables. Nested select statements are used instead.\nFilter actions that are set up to run on menu now also create a selection before running the action. This change allows these actions to be run from the tooltip and cleared by clearing the selection.\nOptimized performance for Oracle database queries that have filters that use numeric data types.\nThe application would sometimes become briefly unresponsive before running a custom value list or wildcard match quick filter. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application now caches information about whether a field is valid, which can improve performance in very slow workbooks.\nLabels were getting culled too aggressively. This issue has been corrected and labels behave as they did in earlier versions.\nWhen connected to CSV files, aggregating a measure as a Standard Deviation (STDEV) would return different results depending on whether connecting to the live data source or an extract. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when filtering on null values. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application would unexpectedly exit when formatting a view in a dashboard using the Format window. This issue has been corrected.\nDuring extract refreshes the following message would sometimes display: \"Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: Cannot create a file when that file already exists.\" This problem has been fixed.\nSome boolean calculated fields that referenced secondary data sources would return inconsistent results when used in different workbooks. These workbooks are corrected by saving the workbook using version 7.0.6 and reopening them.\nReplacing a data source with a Tableau Server data source could fail with a \"no such column\" error. This error was caused when a workbook contained context filters and calculated fields that were materialized in the data server. This issue has been corrected and replacing a data source in these cases no longer causes an error.\nWhile viewing a dashboard, running an action from the tooltip without first making a selection could cause a \"Commit called on nested editor\" error. This issue has been corrected and the action no longer causes an error.\nThe quick sort options were incorrectly available in the toolbar when table calculation headers were selected. These fields can be manually sorted but computed sorts are now correctly disabled.\nImproved performance for changing global quick filters that apply to several extract data sources.\nManually sorting a table calculation field was no longer available. This feature has been restored and you can now sort these fields as expected.\nTable calculation fields that were on the filter shelf and used elsewhere in the view, would be invalid in version 7.0.5 because of how the application was determining the fields available for addressing. This issue has been corrected and these fields are no longer invalid.\nTableau Server\nCorrected an issue where filters that functioned in Tableau Desktop sometimes didn't function after the workbook was published to Tableau Server when \"Show Sheets as Tabs\" was cleared.\nOptimizations were made in the number of seconds it takes to load a view.\nAddressed a security issue related to cookies.\nThere were problems using the tabcmd GET command to get groups.xml. Not every group was included. This issue has been corrected.\nUsing the \"View underlying data\" option on the tooltip sometimes resulted in an \"out of memory\" error when the data set was extremely large. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem with exporting a view as a PDF using the Unspecified paper size.\nDue to issues with the JRE that shipped with version 7.0.2, migrating to version 7.0.2 from an earlier version sometimes resulted in a \"tabmigrate.bat\" error. This issue has been corrected.\nIssues related to working with very large Active Directory groups have been corrected, including importing and synchronizing.\nPreviously, a blue line sometimes appeared on dashboards set to an exact size (instead of 'Automatic'). This issue has been corrected.\nIn certain circumstances, Tableau Server would not release unneeded system resources, thus causing \"out of memory\" errors. This issue no longer occurs.\nPublished workbooks viewed with an iPad sometimes displayed encoding when a date was entered into a date parameter. This issue has been corrected.\nActive Directory groups whose name included special characters (such as the umlaut) sometimes didn't import correctly. This issue has been corrected.\nThe \"Show Fewer Values\" quick filter displays only values for which you have data. There was an issue when this filter was enabled and there were >200 values. The index that was operated on for selections was that of \"Show More Values\" not \"Show Fewer Values\". This issue has been corrected.\nThe tooltip for the reap extracts server task (in Administrative Views) now displays the number of bytes that are successfully deleted. It also displays the number of bytes that cannot be deleted--for example, because they are being held by active sessions.\nCorrected an issue that sometimes made \"date-only\" parameters display time.\nAfter setting a new customized view as the Default then republishing the view, the Default view was sometimes lost. This issue has been corrected.\nA published dashboard that had been set to a range of sizes then exported to PDF would resize to the smallest setting and not return to other sizes until the user either logged out or clicked the Revert All button. This issue has been corrected.\nSynchronizing Active Directory groups sometimes resulted in users being removed from the groups incorrectly. Groups are now synchronized correctly.\nThe tabcmd syncgroup command would fail to license users the first time it was run, but it would succeed the second time. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected inconsistencies in how Tableau Server handled UTF-8 and UTF-16 files, including CSV files which are used to import users. Also added support for ISO-8859-2, which is part of the ISO 8859 series of ASCII-based character encodings.\nTableau Server sometimes erroneously displayed a â€œMultiple Tableau Server connections are not supportedâ€? message when opening a workbook that connected to a republished, packaged Tableau Server data source (.TDSX). This problem has been corrected.\nTableau Server failed to import certain Active Directory groups because their names contained special characters that Tableau Server didn't recognize. This issue has been corrected.\nPreviously, the vizql server process would sometimes hang after stopping and starting the server. This issue has been addressed and the process now executed correctly.\nAfter restarting Tableau Server, the wgserver process sometimes failed to stop and start. This issue has been corrected.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.6","ReleaseDate":"02/07/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Tableau for Android is now available.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.4","ReleaseDate":"24/05/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nTableau supports two additional languages with this release: Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian).\nAdded support for connecting to SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW). To connect Tableau to SAP BW, you must have the SAP GUI for windows version 7.20 or later and SAP BW version 7.0 or later. It's recommended that you install at least SAP 7.0 SP20+ to leverage important fixes. Learn more about connecting to SAP BW in the Connecting to SAP BW article.\nThis version of Tableau Server includes failover support and the ability to configure a highly available gateway, two features designed to minimize your server system's potential for downtime. For details, refer to the Server Online Help.\nThe SQL Server 2012 driver (code name Denali v11.x) is now supported.\nSeveral improvements were made to the Sites user interface and functionality. System administrators of multi-site server systems can now give content administrators the ability to add users to a site. Content administrators can do this via the UI or through the tabcmd command line utility.\nThis release brings new functionality to the content administrator role if the server is running multiple sites. System administrators can allow content administrators to add and remove server users, as well as set an upper limit for how many users can be added to a site.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when changing the aggregation of a continuous field on the Color shelf after specifying a specific Start or End value for the color ramp.\nCorrected a case where window table calculations could be defined with a start value that was greater than the end value, thus creating an invalid window. In these cases, the formula would validate but cause an error message when trying to use the field in the view. These formulas can no longer be created.\nImproved geocoding performance, which increases rendering speed for filled maps and other geocoding queries.\nUpdated the error message that displays in the calculated field dialog box when using the Modulo function with a non integer value.\nWhen connected to Vectorwise databases, calculated field names were incorrectly case sensitive, which caused the queries to return empty values. This issue has been corrected.\nIn some cases, certain reference lines would be removed after closing and reopening the workbook. This issue has been corrected.\nFilter actions that are set up to run on menu selection now also create a selection before running the action. This change allows these actions to be run from the tooltip and cleared by clearing the selection.\nConnecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database could cause the database error: \"The text, ntext, and image data types cannot be compared or sorted, except when using IS NULL or LIKE operator.\" This error was caused when the remote column name did not match the local column name. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen filtering on fields from a secondary data source, the ATTR aggregation was incorrectly shown as an option for quantitative fields. This issue has been corrected and it is now only available for categorical fields.\nAdded support for the ESPG:4283 geographic projection in WMS maps in order to support a large amount of Australian WMS data.\nTableau Desktop could sometimes unexpectedly crash during start up. This issue was caused by a licensing error that was not being handled correctly. This issue has been corrected.\nCalculations would not always get materialized correctly when refreshing an optimized extract, which could lead to reduced performance. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connected to a Tableau Server data source, editing aliases is now disabled. Previously, you could edit the aliases locally but the changes would not be stored with the workbook.\nActions that run on a menu command were not available when selecting a dimension. This issue has been corrected and the actions are now available when right-clicking a dimension and in the dimension tooltip.\nTableau Desktop would sometimes unexpectedly exit when adding a linking field to the Level of Detail shelf. This issue was caused by an out of memory exception that is now detected.\nWhen opening a workbook that connects to a Tableau Server data source, the error \"no such function, prepare.xml, class DataSourceException\" could occur. This error occurred when the data type for a column was customized before the data source was published. These columns are now being handled correctly and the error no longer occurs.\nTableau Desktop could unexpectedly exit after refreshing extracts that contained a calculated field that uses the DATETRUNC function. This issue has been corrected.\nActions and tooltips that referenced fields that had the greater than (>) and less than (<) symbols in the field names would not run because these characters were not escaped properly. This issue has been corrected.\nAdding to an extract from a file was failing due to hidden sets that were created automatically by actions on dashboards. These hidden sets are no longer taken into account when adding to an extract from a file.\nWorkbooks that connect to extracts from Vertica databases and have calculated fields that use the SPACE() function, would cause a Data Engine error when opening. This error has been corrected and these workbooks now open correctly.\nCreating a view with a custom date that used the M/D/Y format, could cause the error \"Invalid field formula due to limitations in the data source.\" when the field is made continuous. This type of custom date can only be viewed as a discrete dimension and the application and Show Me! have been updated to enforce that.\nSome Polish regions were not correctly filled when using filled maps. This issue has been corrected.\nUsing RAWSQL functions could sometimes cause an error when the calculated field is used in a TOP N filter. This error was due to a side query Tableau would run in order to optimize future queries. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application could unexpectedly exit when adjusting specific types of quick filters. This issue has been corrected.\nAdded an Initial SQL option for connections to IBM DB2 databases. This allows you to define commands that will be run at the initial connect time, which can be useful to set environment options. For example, you can run the SET ISOLATION LEVEL UR command upon connection to allow queries to execute against tables with uncommitted reads.\nOpening specific workbooks that connect to Tableau Server data sources could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue was caused by a naming conflict in parameter names. This issue has been corrected and the conflicting parameters are now given unique names in the data source.\nWhen editing a Teradata connection, the connection information (joins, custom SQL, etc.) was not retained. This issue has been corrected and the connection information is available after a connection is restored.\nSpecific dashboards created from ODBC connections would intermittently cause the application to exit. Tableau now detects this issue and handles it correctly. \nAdded the ability to specify odbc-connect-string-extras via Tableau Data Connections (TDC). You can learn about TDC customization in the Customizing and Tuning ODCB Connections article.\nModified the Edit Locations dialog box to increase performance by only showing unknown locations that are missing from the view when dealing with a large domain. An option has been added to the dialog box to show all unknown locations in these cases.\nWhen changing the aliases of a parameter on the color or size legend, the aliases would sometimes be overridden with original values. This issue has been corrected.\nThe logic used to determine which tables we include in the queries (our join culling) fro Oracle databases now properly account for Oracle synonyms. \nPublishing workbooks that contains custom geocoding would fail if the Include External Files option was not selected. The message has been modified to make this issue more clear.\nIf the target for an action is a dashboard that has a comma in the name, running the action would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nThe rich text editor now recognizes shortcuts that use the Alt and Ctrl+Alt keys so you can type symbols like the euro symbol(â‚¬) using Ctrl+Alt+E.\nThe term \"Yukon Territory\" is now correctly recognized as a synonym of \"Yukon\" in the built-in geocoding.\nThe application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when working with large extracts. This issue was caused by an out of memory error. The error is now handled correctly and the application does not exit.\nTableau now recognizes fields named \"Countries\" when automatically identifying geographic fields. These columns are assigned the \"Country\" geographic role.\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when computing quick filters.\nThe \"Data Update Time\" that can be inserted into titles and captions was not properly representing different locale settings. The time is now always expressed in the time zone of the computer that is opening the workbook. The format is determined by the workbook locale setting.\nThe application would exit with the following message when using certain calculated fields: \"Tableau has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.\" This issue has been corrected.\nEditing aliases for Measure Names would cause the names to be duplicated in the Edit Aliases dialog box. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connecting to Cloudera Hadoop Hive data sources, date functions were not properly taking daylight savings boundaries into account. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen a table calculation was on the Filter shelf the dimensions on the Level of Detail shelf were not available for specifying the addressing for the calculation. This issue has been corrected.\nReplacing a data source now correctly converts actions to use the new data source.\nCertain worksheets would open slower in version 7.0 than in earlier versions. This issue has been corrected.\nSome workbooks would cause intermittent runtime errors when modifying actions on dashboards. These errors have been corrected.\nModified map boundaries to clip at +/- 72 degrees latitude in panes that are much wider than they are tall. In these cases, the map is scaled to ensure all countries are shown. Before this change, the map would be scaled smaller than necessary because it included area all the way to each pole. Now the map can remain a little larger because it is clipped before getting all the way to the poles.\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when changing the layout for specific dashboards.\nGroups and manual sort orders were not always maintained correctly when connecting to SQL Server databases. This issue has been corrected.\nSome dashboards would not update when changing parameter values because the columns were being improperly cached. This issue has been corrected.\nReplacing a SQL Server data source with a Tableau Server data source would sometimes cause the application to exit. This issue has been corrected.\nOptimized ParAccel connections to support multiple row inserts when adding metadata to temporary tables (used when filtering).\nCorrected a case where the application would become unresponsive when opening a worksheet that had a very large number of tick marks on the axis.\nWhen connected to a Tableau Server data source, the Data > Tables menu item was incorrectly available. Modifying the tables in a published data sources is not supported. This menu item is no longer available.\nThe terms \"Newcastle upon Tyne\" and \"Kingston upon Hull\" are now recognized as synonyms for \"Newcastle\" and \"Kingston\" respectively in the built-in geocoding.\nUpdated the Microsoft MSVC runtime DLLs to the latest 2010 SP1 versions to pick up security fixes from Microsoft.\nWhen connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services databases, quick filters for a boolean table calculation would not update correctly. For example, clearing \"False\" would filter the data but the quick filter would still show a check mark next to \"False.\" This issue has been corrected and the quick filter now correctly reflects the filter state.\nDual axis charts would attempt to align zeros even when the \"Include Zero\" option was not selected. This behavior has been changed to not align zeroes unless \"Include Zero\" is selected for both axes.\nProgress OpenEdge connections were not handling bit/boolean (logical) fields properly when using Custom SQL. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where views would not update after changing to a new user in the user filter. The workbook now updates correctly.\nWhen refreshing or removing an extract, which had previously been published to the data serve using embedded database credentials there were cases where it would not be able to complete the refresh of the extract. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a discrepancy in DATE_TRUNC functions results between a live Aster connection and working with an extract from an Aster database. The Aster database calculated dates with Monday as the first day of the week. Tableau uses Sunday as the first day. This difference is now accounted for when creating extracts from Aster.\nGroups and manual sort orders were not always maintained correctly when connecting to SQL Server databases. This issue has been corrected.\nEnabled a TDC customization for Oracle data sources, that allows you to set CAP_QUERY_SUBQUERY_QUERY_CONTEXT to avoid expensive queries involving temporary tables. You can learn about TDC customization in the Customizing and Tuning ODCB Connections article.\nSupport was added for the SQL Server 2012 driver.\nTableau Server\nThe Export Data permission has been renamed to View Underlying Data and cannot be enabled unless View Summary Data is also enabled. These two permissions allow a user to see and download data using the tooltip in Tableau Server.\nCorrected an issue where certain server updates, such as adding new users, would sometimes not take effect.\nThe Online Help for the --site tabcmd option has been updated to reflect that the site's ID, not name, is required to use this option.\nThe version of JRuby used by Tableau Server has been upgraded to 1.6.7, which contains a security patch.\nAddressed a problem where filter actions that were applied by hovering over a mark and clicking the filter link in the tooltip were not being cleared.\nIn earlier versions of Tableau Server, in order to assign a backgrounder server process to a machine you also had to assign it at least one application server process. This is no longer the case.\nCorrected an issue that was causing workbooks connecting to a Teradata database to intermittently fail to load.\nIncreased security for communication to and from the Tableau Data Engine. Tableau Server's data engine will now only accept connections from machines in the cluster.\nFixed an issue where marks in dashboards sometimes appeared to shift slightly when they were highlighted with a mouse-over.\nThere was a problem with published workbooks with identical data connections. One data connection could be successfully edited, while the other could not. This problem has been fixed.\nSelecting \"revert all\" on a dashboard and then exporting to PDF would create multiple copies of the dashboard in the PDF. This issue has been corrected.\nImprovements were made to reduce \"Out of memory\" errors when adequate main memory exists. Specifically, the VizQL, wgserver, background, and data server processes now each use up to 4 GB of RAM per instance instead of 2 GB of RAM when they are installed on a 64-bit operating system. Also, old sessions are now released more quickly when a process is at risk of running out of memory.\nThe \"Session ended by server\" errors now have more informative messages.\nStopping a Tableau Server cluster via the tabadmin stop command sometimes took several minutes. This performance has been improved.\nViews in the process of being loaded sometimes showed a completely blank page instead of the spinner that indicates that the load is underway. This issue has been fixed.\nInstead of being prevented, certain invalid date formats were allowed. When the workbook was published, they would display as \"NaN-NaN-NaN\". Now, invalid date formats are prevented.\nThe tabcmd export command now has better, more informative error handling.\nWorkbooks with a slider control disabled in Tableau Desktop would have the same control enabled after publishing to Tableau Server. This issue has been fixed.\nResolved an issue where published workbooks with a date parameter slider didn't function correctly.\nAn issue was fixed in which a workbook with a live connection to Excel stopped reflecting changes to data when an extract was added and both were published with the \"Include external files\" check box cleared.\nThe \"unsafe\" backup tabadmin command allows you to create a database backup while Tableau Server is running. There was an error where this type of backup was failing. This issue has been fixed.\nIn previous versions, the Space Usage admin view did not show the correct size of workbooks or data sources with extracts. This has been corrected.\nScroll bars were sometimes included in exported PDFs. This issue has been fixed.\nBetter error handling was added for when embed code includes an invalid host URL.\nAfter restoring a \"no config\" backup to a clean install of Tableau Server 7.0, adding a new admin user sometimes resulted in the following error: \"missing attribute: admin_level\". This problem has been fixed.\nAddressed a problem in which fixed size dashboards would sometimes look correct in Tableau Desktop but not after they were published to Tableau Server.\nA problem was fixed for workbooks that are published without tabs and that include filter actions that run on Select. Previously, when such a workbook was published, making a selection sometimes resulted in another browser window launching with a malformed URL. Note that if a view's filter action is created with no target field, making a selection results in nothing happening. This is by design.\nA licensing error occurred when users published workbooks that connected to Tableau Server data sources. Specifically, the error occurred when the data source was created and published using dissimilar editions of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. For example, an OEM edition of Tableau Desktop and a non-OEM edition of Tableau Server. This issue has been corrected.\nAddressed a problem where tooltips sometimes didn't display long enough for users to interact with them and make selections on the tooltip.\nPreviously, it was possible for an invalid (unlicensed) Tableau Server user to initiate an extract refresh using the tabcmd utility. This is now prevented.\nA tabadmin setting (vizqlserver.trustedticket.log_level) was added to provide more data about trusted authentication requests and responses. The default setting is \"info\". For a more details, set it to \"debug\".\nViews that prompted Tableau Server users for database credentials were not loading correctly if the Tableau Server Guest account was being used. This problem has been fixed.\nResolved a problem where date/range filters in Tableau Desktop were being published as date/time filters.\nViews with reference lines now correctly retain the references lines when they are modified and saved as custom views.\nFixed an issue in which views embedded with the email Share option weren't always loading correcting.\nFixed an issue where custom views including groups could not be saved.\nLogging during Setup was improved to better disclose any issues that prevent Tableau Server from installing, such as certain ports not being available.\nYou can create a workbook with a date field parameter that \"steps forward\" by an interval you specify, such as a certain number of days. When such a workbook was published, however, an incorrect interval was used. This issue has been resolved.\nThe tabcmd export command was enhanced to expose settings for Page Size and Page Orientation (defaults are Letter and Portrait, respectively). Learn more about these options in the Server Online Help.\nA number of issues were fixed related to when Tableau Server is configured to use SSL and a reverse proxy server.\nWhen Tableau Server was configured to use Active Directory for user authentication, user names that included diacritic characters (such as a \"u\" with an umlaut) did not display correctly. This issue has been fixed.\nThere were issues with displaying a scrolling view on an iPad in landscape orientation, including the x axis sometimes not being included. These issues have been corrected.\nBecause of an internal timestamp issue, embedded views using trusted tickets sometimes returned a 'Couldn't validate request' error after being clicked. This issue has been fixed.\nA problem was fixed with the tabadmin ziplogs -d option. It now correctly allows you to only include logs since a certain date.\nIn earlier versions of Tableau Desktop it was possible to publish a workbook that relied on external files with the \"Include External Files\" check box cleared. Now a message appears to confirm that this is your intent.\nFor certain connections, you can create custom initial SQL statements. There was a problem where editing the connection on Tableau Server removed the initial SQL. This issue has been fixed.\nTableau Server's drop-down menus now work in Opera 11.62.\nLoading a view sometimes resulted in an error message that read, \"The system cannot find the file specified\". This issue has been fixed.\nAdministrators logging into a non-default site sometimes saw a \"Service down\" red X appear next to certain services on the site's Maintenance page. This issue has been fixed.\nViews would sometimes fail to load and the error message 'java.lang.NullPointerException' would be in the Windows Event Viewer and Tableau VizQL log files. This issue no longer occurs.\nPreviously, every time tabadmin was run a binary jffi*.tmp file was created in the TEMP directory and not removed after the command had been run. This problem has been fixed.\nFixed an issue where the \"slider\" for a range of dates disappeared after the view was published.\nFixed a problem with DateTime quick filters in which they would display correctly in Tableau Desktop but incorrectly after being published to Tableau Server.\nTableau Server data source connections sometimes failed for all users but the data source publisher. This issue no longer occurs.\nThe number of asynchronous wgserver background threads was increased to better handle Tableau database connection requests made via tabcmd get.\nCorrected a problem in which Tableau was not correctly interpreting the DB2 \"connection closed\" message and was itself returning a \"Session Ended by Server\" error.\nThe modified dates for projects and views were sometimes incorrect after an upgrade to version 7.0.3. This issue has been fixed.\nPreviously, users from different domains who belonged to multiple sites were not able to log into Tableau Server. This is no longer the case.\nPreviously, setting then clearing a workbook as a favorite on iPad returned error code 406. This no longer occurs.\nIf you were logged into Tableau Server with a username that contained a space, it wasn't possible to load a custom view (infinite spinner). This problem has been fixed.\nIf you upgraded from version 7.0.x to 7.0.3 and were running multiple sites, you may not have been able to add or edit sites. This problem has been fixed.\nCertain date formats in Tableau Desktop include text. Workbooks published using non-English locales were not properly escaping the text so that it displayed in the correct language when published. This issue has been fixed.\nOpening a workbook from the Filter by Publisher page sometimes resulted in an internal error page displaying. This issue has been fixed.\nA security issue was fixed in the data server logs.\nFixed a problem where weekdays would be correctly displayed in a quick filter in Tableau Desktop but not after publishing to Tableau Server.\nFixed an issue involving adding a worker to the Tableau Server configuration, in which the worker being added failed to initialize.\nWhen modifying all data connections across multiple pages (clicking the select all button twice), an undefined method error could occur and the connections would not be updated. This issue has been corrected.\nThere was a problem with changing user account Start page settings, including Language and Locale, on sites other than the Default site. That problem has been fixed.\nPreviously, there were problems with restoring a .tsbak file to a Windows 2003 server. This is now fixed.\nThere were issues with Tableau Server data sources that were created from NetezzaSQL data sources. Connecting to the Tableau Server data source sometimes resulted in the error \"Function 'TRUNC(INT4)' does not exist\". This has been fixed.\nCorrected a problem in which dashboards with URL filter actions weren't loading properly in Internet Explorer.\nPreviously, there were some issues with product keys sometimes appearing twice on the Licenses page. This has been fixed.\nCorrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.\nFixed an issue where pausing \"Automatic Updates\" on a published view, changing quick filters, then resuming the updates resulted in a blank view.\nThe --administrator option is one of the options you can use with the tabcmd syncgroup command. In earlier versions it assigned the Administrator user right to a group of users. Now it also allows you to designate an Administrator type of system, content, or none.\nSeveral security improvements were made, including better prevention of SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.\nAdded a configuration option to disable auto-complete for the username field on the login page. The new setting is wgserver.no_user_autocomplete. To disable the auto-complete for username, set this value to true. The default is to have auto-complete for usernames. The command to disable this would be: tabconfig set wgserver.no_user_autocomplete true\nAdditional Considerations\nMaps displayed in Spanish and Portuguese-Brazilian versions will show English text for all labels on the maps. The English text is temporary while we finish creating the updated maps with the translated labels. Once the translated maps are available they will automatically appear. The translated maps are anticipated to be ready later this summer.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.4","ReleaseDate":"24/05/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Tableau supports two additional languages with this release: Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian).","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.4","ReleaseDate":"24/05/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau supports two additional languages with this release: Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian)."},{"entry":"Added support for connecting to SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW).

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.2","ReleaseDate":"22/03/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nAdded the ability to create multiple customized versions of a view that can be shared, or \"advertised,\" to other users. You can customize views while browsing Tableau Server or while interacting with an embedded view.You can also embed a custom view.\nAdded support for connecting to Teradata 14.0.\nAdded support for connecting to Progress OpenEdge 11.0.\nAdded support for the 4.6.3 Aster nCluster ODBC driver. If that driver is installed it will be used to connect to Aster Ncluster databases version 4.6 and higher. Using this driver corrects a memory problem when performing large queries.\nAdded support for connecting to Vertica 5.1.\nSites information has been added to the Administrative Views section of the Maintenance page.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nUpdated city and state names in the built-in geocoding for several cities around the world.\nCopying and pasting table calculation fields between workbooks now correctly includes the default table calculation information including the Compute using option.\nChanging the aggregation for a mark label that has been manually positioned would move the label back to the default position. This issue has been corrected for most cases. The custom position is not maintained when the field that defines the mark labels is on multiple shelves with multiple aggregations.\nThe field drop-down menu when targeting select fields for a filter action, now distinguishes between discrete date parts and continuous date values.\nWhen defining an advanced ordering for a table calculation, you can now select an \"Automatic\" option when specifying the sort order. The automatic option uses the default sort order of the fields.\nCorrected a case where custom relationships on continuous date fields were not being maintained correctly. This issue would cause the view to appear differently when the workbook was closed and reopened.\nCustom relationships for a blended data source were not included when duplicating the connection. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue when selecting to 'show missing values' could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.\nThe application would unexpectedly exit when creating a custom date from a DATETIME parameter. You can no longer create custom dates from parameters.\nHaving a large number of saved data sources would compress the Tableau Server data sources area on the Connect to Data page. The saved data sources area is now a fixed size and scroll bars display as necessary.\nImporting custom geocoding was causing a database error on machine's where the repository path contained non-ANSI characters (e.g., diacritics). This issue has been corrected by creating a temporary directory during the import that has a \"safe\" path name and then converting back to the correct path name after the import completes.\nIn some cases, selecting a header and clicking the quick sort options in the toolbar would sort the fields differently than in earlier versions. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue where some large groups could cause the application to unexpectedly exit with the error message, \"An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.\"\nCorrected a number of areas in the reference lines dialog box that were not properly localized.\nThe Page card would display on the left side of the workbook regardless of whether it had been moved to the right side of the sheet in earlier versions of the application. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where turning on totals for some views involving sets would cause a \"Couldn't find a key during dictionary lookup\" error.\nCorrected built-in geocoding locations for many zip codes throughout the United States.\nCorrected a case where views would not update after changing to a new user in the user filter. The workbook now updates correctly.\nCorrected an issue where a license expired message would display with a negative date on systems where the date format is set to \"ddd MMM dd yyyy.\"\nThe application would sometimes get stuck when switching the background map source from the Online option to a WMS server.\nConnecting to SQL Azure using the Microsoft SQL Server connection dialog box would cause an error when loading the list of database tables. This issue has been corrected. Due to limitations of SQL Azure, the OLE DB protocol cannot be used in the same way as SQL Server. Instead Tableau falls back to using a Native ODBC connection as needed. This change does not affect normal connections to SQL Server.\nCorrected an issue where filtering or sorting on a dimension whose members contains umlaut characters would cause an \"Illegal mix of collations\" error.\nSome line charts would not always draw the same as they had in earlier versions. Specifically, more lines than expected were included due to null values. This issue has been corrected and the line charts now match earlier versions.\nShow Me! would sometimes remove fields unexpectedly when using it with a view that has multiple mark types (e.g., lines and bars) This issue has been corrected.\nModifying aliases for members of a set would cause an error and in some cases the application would exit. Aliasing members of a set should not be supported, and the option has been removed from the context menu.\nIn some line charts, the mark labels were displayed in the upper left corner of the view instead of along the line. This issue has been corrected and mark labels now display correctly.\nThe application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when replacing an Excel data source with another data source. This issue has been corrected.\nThe Create Hierarchy option for relational data sources would only display in the context menu when another hierarchy already existed. This issue has been corrected and the Create Hierarchy option is now available when right clicking dimensions in the Data window.\nCorrected an issue where Tableau could unexpectedly exit when selecting to logon to Tableau Server.\nTableau would sometimes use an underscore character (_) at the beginning of table names, which would cause problems when connecting to generic ODBC data sources. This issue has been corrected and table names always begin with an alpha character.\nThe manual sort option was not available when setting the default sort order for a set. This functionality was available in earlier versions but was removed with version 7.0. The manual sort option has been restored.\nWhen publishing a workbook to Tableau Server, the default authentication method for Tableau Server data sources has been changed from \"Prompt user\" to \"Embedded.\" Other data sources continue to default to \"Prompt user.\"\nReplacing a data source that contains a server defined group with another data source could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nUpdated the error message that displays in the calculated field dialog box when using the Modulo function with a non integer value.\nWhen exporting data to Microsoft Access, the resulting table would sort the columns alphabetically based on their underlying column names instead of the aliases in Tableau. These columns are now sorted based on their Tableau aliases during export.\nTableau Server\nImprovements were made to how quickly Tableau Server responds after a published view is clicked (or tapped).\nVarious improvements were made to memory usage.\nIt now takes less time to launch the server Configuration dialog box ('tabadmin config').\nThere was a problem with installing Tableau Server on a Simplified Chinese Windows 2008 operating system or a Turkish operating system. This issue has been corrected.\nGroups in published data sources were not always being correctly refreshed when the data source was changed and republished. This issue has been corrected.\nExtended characters in the Comments field sometimes resulted in the comment text being truncated. This issue has been corrected.\nThe default number of minutes of idle time after which a VizQL session is discarded has been changed from 120 to 30 minutes. Closing these sessions more frequently releases memory on the server, thus improving server performance. To change the default value of 30 minutes, you can use the tabadmin vizqlserver.session.expiry.timeout setting.\nAn error message reading \"console is undefined\" would sometimes display after an embedded view was loaded in an HTML page. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen migrating from a v6 to v7 server, corrected a problem which would cause the error 'javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException: Unable to find com.tableausoftware.model.workgroup.Workbook with id '.\nReconfiguring the number of backgrounder processes sometimes had no effect. This issue has been corrected.\nIf a version 6.x server had a customized setting for the java.heap.size (when a version 6.x admin had run a command such as: tabadmin set java.heap size 1024m) then migrating to version 7.0 could fail with the error \"Unable to upgrade <path>/tabsvc.yml to latest version\". This issue has been corrected. The java.heap.size setting no longer impacts the server due to architectural changes to the repository.\nThere was an issue with restoring a version 6.1 backup to a version 7.0 server if, in the version 6.1 environment, there was no Default project or All Users group. This issue has been corrected.\nHighlighting some of a view's data and clicking \"Download all rows as a text file\" sometimes resulted in not all of the data downloading. This problem has been fixed.\nStarting with version 7.0, several server processes were re-engineered to be multi- instead of single-threaded. Because they are now more powerful than in previous releases, eight is the maximum number of processes you can run. You can configure this via the Servers tab in the Configuration utility. To change the upper limit from eight to another number, use the service.max_procs tabadmin setting. For more information, see the Tableau Server Online Help.\nPasting a list of items from the clipboard into a filter defined as a custom value list on Tableau Server would not always succeed. Specifically, the problem occurred if the data came from a source that used multiple formats for the data, such as Excel. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem where workbooks connecting to the Data Server to pass queries through to a database could cause a \"500 Internal Server Error\" when using the tabcmd utility to retrieve a PDF or PNG of the file.\nExported CSV data from Tableau Server ignored the 'List separator' value specified in the Windows locale settings. This issue has been corrected.\nRe-importing a user from Active Directory with their name capitalized differently didn't work. This issue has been corrected.\nThe server cache setting \"Refresh More Often\" was not working. This issue has been fixed.\nRunning Tableau Server on a port other than 80 would cause some temp files after refreshing extracts to not be properly cleaned up, which could consume large amounts of disk space. This issue has been corrected.\nIn some cases, Tableau Server failed to install and the tabadmin.log showed that there were permissions issues (for example, \"Unable to init component Components::Database\"). This problem has been resolved.\nWhen a hidden field has the same name as a URL parameter, the URL specified filter should be applied to the parameter. There was a problem in which the filter was being applied to the hidden field instead. This issue has been corrected.\nSome customers upgrading from 7.0 to 7.0.1 experienced broken filter and view titles and missing image icons after the upgrade. This problem has been fixed.\nYou can designate a worker server to run the data engine. There was an issue where, if your first configuration attempt failed, any time you added an additional worker, the server would try to move the data engine to it. This has been corrected and a failed move will no longer result in an automatic retry.\nOptimizations were made to where the extract refresh process is handled. In some cases, the result will be faster data extract refreshes.\nAn internal error sometimes occurred when using the export tabcmd to export a view as a pdf from a non-default site. This problem has been fixed.\nA problem was corrected with the server \"reap extracts\" task which could potentially cause temp files to accumulate on the server.\nCorrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.\nQuick filter titles now load correctly in Google Chrome version 16.0.912.77.\nData connections using ODBC were not correctly embedding passwords. This issue has been fixed.\nTableau Server now correctly sets its cookies with the secure flag in a proxy server environment in which the proxy is configured for SSL but Tableau Server is not.\nIn situations where multiple groups were in the Groups page of Tableau Server, all members of each group were displayed, and not in alphabetical order. Now, lists of 10-15 members display in alphabetical order and a \"More...\" link lets you see additional group members.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.2","ReleaseDate":"22/03/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Added the ability to create multiple customized versions of a view that can be shared, or \"advertised,\" to other users.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nAdded support for connecting to Sybase IQ 15.3.\nAdded support for connecting to ParAccel 3.1.\nAdded Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) to filled maps for the United States.\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nWhen publishing a workbook with multiple connections, opening the Authentication dialog to specify authentication options now allows you to select multiple connections (hold the CTRL-key on your keyboard) to change the settings for multiple connections at once.\nCorrected how continuous date fields are labeled to correctly account for fiscal years that do not start in January.\nModified the Tableau Server Data Connection dialog box to make it easier to edit connections to published data sources.\nA published data source that included a hierarchy could not be edited and republished to remove the hierarchy. This issue has been fixed.\nEditing a parameter-based percentile reference line resulted in the application exiting. This issue has been fixed.\nA workbook with more than 100 parameters would start to show duplicate parameter names at the bottom of the Analysis > Parameters menu. This issue has been fixed.\nData labels were not displaying in horizontal continuous area charts. These labels now display correctly.\nConnecting to a Hadoop Hive data source via the Tableau Data Server would fail to create extracts with the error \"Incorrect data type.\" This issue has been fixed.\nOpening workbooks from earlier versions would not properly display field substitution values in the titles and captions. These values are now displayed as expected.\nThe Portuguese cities of Beja and Guarda have been added to our city geocoding data.\nCustom relationships between data sources were not properly updated after replacing a data source. These relationships are now updated correctly.\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit while editing a distribution reference line that used a parameter.\nWhen working with multiple data sources with custom relationships between them, editing a relationship to remove all fields(leaving an undefined relationship) would save the empty state of the relationship when the workbook was saved. This issue has been fixed.\nTableau could unexpectedly exit when modifying the color of a gradient color legend. This issue has been fixed.\nCorrected an issue with editing the color palette for a discrete calculated dimension that's been converted to continuous.\nRight-clicking in an axis when using measure values and cube data sources could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.\nUsing filled maps and fields with table calculations could cause the error \"The query results are missing a tuple required for computing totals.\" This issue has been fixed.\nYou can no longer add a new dimension to an existing hierarchy when the hierarchy was pre-defined in a TDS on Tableau Server. Hierarchies in this scenario should be read-only and attempting to modify them would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.\nIncremental extract refreshes could cause calculated fields to become unusable after the second incremental refresh. This issue has been fixed.\nCreating a highlight action without selecting the specific fields to highlight could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. Tableau now prompts you to select fields to target.\nThe link to the Online Help from the Teradata Connection Advanced Settings dialog was incorrect. This has been fixed.\nOpening workbooks connecting to Oracle databases where filters or sets have become invalid due to changes on the database could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.\nCorrected some cases where logarithmic axis labeling would show fewer tick mark labels than expected.\nCorrected the placement of zip code 49931.\nOptimized performance when opening workbooks with large extracts and a large number of unique dimension values in the worksheet. One example is a workbook with a 60 million row extract and over 2 million unique values in a field on the row shelf. This workbook originally took over 10 minutes to open and now takes about 2 minutes.\nChanging the data type of a field from Date to String would cause the quick filter for that field to disappear after saving and reopening the workbook.\nOn the Start page, thumbnail images for workbooks opened from an SSL-enabled server now properly include the https part of the URL.\nWhile creating an extract, if the connection between Tableau and the database server is interrupted, Tableau Desktop could unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.\nWhen refreshing an extract that includes a calculated string field that uses a string field from a secondary , the connection to the secondary data source would not prompt to log in and would then fail. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem creating an extract from MySQL columns defined as a Time() datatype.\nIn rare cases, opening a packaged workbook (twbx) file would fail with the error \"Unspecified error.\" The underlying problem was the packaged file contained an embedded image that was created without a modified date property. This issue has been corrected.\nAfter selecting File > Print to PDF, immediately cancelling could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue with multi-table connections using ODBC connections when the source database does not support the SQL TOP clause.\nTableau Server\nSupport was added for the non-standard LDAP port for the Global Catalog. See http://kb.tableausoftware.com/articles/knowledgebase/configuring-tableau-server-for-global-catalog for details.\nThe number displayed for \"All Users\" was sometimes incorrect. This issue has been fixed.\nThe Administrative view \"Space Usage\" was updated to include data about data sources as well as workbooks.\nThere was a problem involving deleting Tableau Server users who no longer existed in Active Directory. This issue has been fixed.\nChanging a quick filter that had values with non-English characters (such as Danish or Swedish characters) sometimes resulted in the error \"Unexpected Server Error: Could not obtain from session sheet: .\" This problem has been fixed.\nTableau updated the PostgreSQL database from version 9.0.4 to 9.0.5.\nA problem was fixed with the layout of exported/printed workbooks.\nA problem was fixed related to the tabcmd export --fullpdf command.\nA problem was fixed where Tableau Server Setup wouldn't complete and the error \"Invalid identifier\" was displayed.\nThe setting Enable Guest allows users to see embedded views without having to log in to Tableau Server. This setting wasn't being properly invoked when, with Enable Guest selected, a user without access to a site was prompted for credentials when attempting to access one of the site's embedded views. This issue has been fixed.\nThere was an issue with adding users whose usernames exceeded 20 characters. This issue has been fixed.\nCorrected display problems with horizontal legends that weren't always displaying the last few entries.\nCorrected unusual behavior in filter values when a filter existed on both a column and a set--which was comprised in part from that same column). Unusual behavior sometimes occurred when deselecting combinations of values from the base column and members of the set.\nThe tooltip user-experience was improved, including decreasing the time the tooltip displays after you've moved your mouse.\nCorrected problems when connecting to Tableau Server through an SSL proxy.\nContent Administrators were not able to successfully add users via importing a CSV file. This issue has been corrected.\nA problem with the \"Last viewed\" timestamp was corrected.\nPublishing very large data sources could cause the error \"Internal server error. Response code: 500\". This issue has been fixed.\nClicking the Clear button to \"Clear my saved passwords\" on the User Account page was not working. It now works correctly.\nChanges were made related to jruby temp directories, including modifying the 'tabadmin cleanup' command so that it removes them when executed.\nUsers logged into a site other than the Default site were not able to change their passwords. This issue has been corrected.\nDate range quick filters could have the end date type-in field incorrectly sized. This caused the first few characters that were typed in to not appear. This issue has been corrected.\nTabadmin.exe was not running correctly when invoked from a directory other than the Tableau Server\\bin directory. This has been corrected and you can now run tabadmin from any directory.\nFixed an issue where a workbook with a single select filter containing one selected option looked correct in Desktop but incorrect when published to Tableau Server.\nCorrected an issue that was causing workbooks connecting to a Teradata database to intermittently fail to load.\nDownloading workbooks from a version 7.0 server could fail with error \"You don't have permission to access <workbook> on this server\" or \"An error occurred when loading from the Tableau Server\". This would occur on systems using Active Directory (AD) with either a large number of security groups or groups that spanned multiple AD domains. This problem has been corrected.\nTableau Server users running Internet Explorer 7 or 8 were unable to download exported data, crosstabs, or PDFs from an SSL-enabled Tableau Server -- even though their license level should have allowed them to do so. This problem has been fixed.\nTableau trusted authentication would not correctly authenticate a session if the workbook or site the workbook belonged to was named 'trusted'.\nCorrected a display problem with horizontal legends getting scroll bars that obscure the legend entries.\nWhen a view was embedded inside an Iframe that used a URL action that was run on \"Menu\" with &:linktarget=_self added to the end of the embedded URL, it did not open the action inside the same window as requested. Instead, it incorrectly opened the target in a new tab. This has been corrected and the linktarget=value is now honored.\nCertain session-related 500 errors were not being handled correctly, resulting in views that wouldnâ€™t finish loading (permanent â€œspinnersâ€?). This issue has been fixed.\nTooltips would disappear too quickly when using Internet Explorer browsers, making it difficult to select links in the tooltip. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a potential security vulnerability where Get requests to Tableau Server could potentially be exploited to run local JavaScript in the browser. This issue has been corrected.\nUsing tabcmd get <workbookname> for very large workbooks could cause tabcmd to fail with the error \"*** failed to allocate memory\". This issue has been corrected.\nWhen an embedded view has reached a session timeout due to inactivity, on next reload it could display in a non-embedded mode (with the Tableau masthead). This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem when assigning permissions that could cause the error \"Tableau Server encountered an error reading or writing data during the last request.\"\nThe &:revert=all URL parameter for embedded views was causing the error 'Session Ended by Server.' This issue has been corrected and this option now correctly restores the view back to its original state.\nThe options to suppress the Share and Download links on embedded views were being ignored. This has been corrected. These are controlled by the configuration settings 'tabadmin set vizqlserver.showshare false' and 'tabadmin set vizqlserver.showdownload false'.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Added support for connecting to Sybase IQ 15.3.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Added support for connecting to Sybase IQ 15.3."},{"entry":"Added support for connecting to ParAccel 3.1.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Added support for connecting to ParAccel 3.1."},{"entry":"Added Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) to filled maps for the United States.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Added Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) to filled maps for the United States."},{"entry":"Corrected Issues","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Corrected Issues"},{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"When publishing a workbook with multiple connections, opening the Authentication dialog to specify authentication options now allows you to select multiple connections (hold the CTRL-key on your keyboard) to change the settings for multiple connections at once.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"When publishing a workbook with multiple connections, opening the Authentication dialog to specify authentication options now allows you to select multiple connections (hold the CTRL-key on your keyboard) to change the settings for multiple connections at once."},{"entry":"Corrected how continuous date fields are labeled to correctly account for fiscal years that do not start in January.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Corrected how continuous date fields are labeled to correctly account for fiscal years that do not start in January."},{"entry":"Modified the Tableau Server Data Connection dialog box to make it easier to edit connections to published data sources.","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0.1","ReleaseDate":"21/02/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Modified the Tableau Server Data Connection dialog box to make it easier to edit connections to published data sources."},{"entry":"A published data source that included a hierarchy could not be edited and republished to remove the hierarchy.

{"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"17/01/2012","ReleaseContents":"New Capabilities\nTableau 7.0 will empower you with new visualizations like filled maps and area charts. It is also easier to use with an improved Show Me interface, one-click sorting and interactive tooltips. Large organizations will love Multi-Tenancy and significantly improved scalability and performance. \n+ See what's new in Tableau <<Some Version>>\nCorrected Issues\nTableau Desktop\nThere were cases where you could assign the same alias to multiple values, which is generally not allowed. In these cases the change to the alias was not saved with the document. Tableau now provides a warning in all cases when incorrectly assigning a duplicate alias.\nCorrected an issue when connecting to Oracle databases where the PLAN_TABLE$ could remain open even when the Tableau session had gone idle. This issue could potentially block other database maintenance tasks from happening.\nUsing table calculations could cause slight differences in the queries generated, which would cause Tableau to miss the query cache and needless queries would be sent to the database. This issue has been corrected.\nExporting to a crosstab when using Table Calculations could cause incorrect calculations in the exported data if the table calculation direction was swapped.\nThe option to display quick filters for hidden worksheets on a dashboard is now available.\nAlias names for groups were lost when the field was duplicated. Aliases are now correctly retained.\nCorrected the spelling of several Norwegian state/county names for the Tableau Geocoding matches.\nOptimized performance when creating incremental updates. In one scenario of an extract with 32 million rows, performing an incremental update was reduced from 23 minutes and 38 seconds to 1 minute and 16 seconds.\nTableau Desktop now prevents workbooks that use extracts created in version 5 or earlier from being published to the server. The extract in the workbook must first be upgraded to a data engine format prior to publishing.\nTableau will no longer load DLLs from the working directory (the directory where a .twb file is being opened from). This prevents one form of security vulnerability where an attacker could put a malicious DLL into the same directory as the .twb file being opened.\nPressing Ctrl + C on your keyboard to copy data selected in the filter dialog once again performs the copy as it did in version 5.\nOptimized performance when calculating quick filters. One example of the improvement is when opening a particular workbook with many quick filters. The time to open (including the time to initially calculate the quick filter values) went from 429 seconds to 112 seconds.\nSetting the confidence intervals for reference lines now includes the option to specify any value from 0 to 100, rather than only a list of pre-defined values.\nThe Force Y intercept to zero trend line option is no longer disabled for continuous dates.\nCorrected an issue that prevented connecting to Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP provider version 10 (pre-Denali) data sources using an Analysis Services OLAP provider version 11 (Denali) driver.\nRenamed the geographic role for CBSAs (core based statistical areas) to better reflect that MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas) are also part of this option.\nImporting text files into a Tableau extract could in some cases add extra blank rows to the end of the data. This issue has been corrected.\nCreating an extract with the option to Aggregate Data for Visible Dimensions now correctly aggregates all measures.\nTableau now warns you when trying to saving a workbook to a read-only folder.\nSaving a custom table calculation when using Measure Values on the Text shelf and filtering Measure Names to show only one measure would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nLarge append extracts would sometimes fail when combining the new data with the existing. Some of these cases have been corrected and additional logging has been added to help with future related issues.\nTableau Server\nThe tabcmd refreshextracts command was not working when the workbook name included spaces. This issue has been corrected.\nAdded a new configuration option, wgserver.logout.close_vizql_sessions, which can be set via the tabadmin utility. When set to yes, this option immediately destroys all vizql server sessions associated with a wgserver session at the time the browser logs out. Without this setting, the vizql server sessions remain allocated until the normal server session timeout setting. Immediately destroying the sessions at logout can slow down the logout command, but will free resources on the server and prevent accidental access to the session data when pressing the back button in the browser.\nThe version of the Apache HTTP Server included with Tableau Server has been updated to version 2.2.21.\nDynamic pages returned from Tableau Server now include 'cache-control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate' and 'pragma: no-cache' in the http headers.\nThe tabcmd refreshextracts command now includes the flag --incremental to instruct the server to do an incremental refresh.\nWhen using Tableau Server to view a workbook created in a non-U.S. locale, clicking to edit Quick Filter Dates would cause the date value to revert to standard American date format (MM/DD/YYYY), instead of a locale appropriate format. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connecting to Tableau Server from earlier versions of Desktop required the publish right. This restriction has been lifted to provide access to the Data Server. Desktop users now only need a valid account on the server to connect and no longer require the publish right.\nNull filter values now correctly displays as blank instead of zero.\nCorrected an issue where all server users were periodically set to 'Unlicensed.'\nInstalling a worker server and configuring it to run the Data Engine could cause the configuration process to stall. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau Server views now correctly show scrollbars in the view when running on Safari on Mac OS X Lion (10.7).\nCorrected a security vulnerability where the /users page could be a vehicle for a SQL injection attack.\nTableau Server now allows usernames from Active Directory to be longer than 20 characters.\nCorrected several unusual behaviors with single select quick filters when using multidimensional (cube) data sources on an iPad.\nTooltips would disappear too quickly when using Internet Explorer browsers, making it difficult to select links in the tooltip. This issue has been corrected.\nIn the mobile client, clearing the \"All\" option on an exclusive quick filter now selects the other marks and excludes them as expected.\nCorrected a case where tabadmin license --repair_service was not correctly repairing the service.\nAdditional Considerations\nTableau Server is no longer supported on Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems.\nTableau Server installs do not correctly complete when the Regional Language option of Windows is set to Simplified Chinese. Change the language option to US English then install the product. After the install completes, you can change the setting back.\nWhen connected to Tableau Server through an SSL proxy, the navigation links along the left side of the server pages point to the actual server instead of the proxy. This issue will be corrected in an upcoming maintenance release.\nUpgrading to Tableau Server 7.0 from earlier versions doesnâ€™t always show a progress dialog box. Version 7.0 introduces a new repository so the upgrade requires migrating old workbooks to the new repository. If you have many workbooks, the upgrade can take longer than usual and will appear unresponsive without the progress dialog. Learn more about Upgrading Tableau Server and troubleshoot errors that can occur during migration.\nWhen embedding Tableau Server views into other applications there is no longer the option to display comments as part of the embedded content.\nTableau products now require your computer to have at least a Pentium 4 (released in 2001) or ADM Opteron (released in 2003) processor. These are the first processors which include the SSE2 instruction set which Tableau now requires.\nThe tabcmd utility and the Tableau Configuration program may perform more slowly than prior releases. These performance slowdowns will be addressed in a future maintenance release.\nEmbedded views do not include comments regardless of whether the comments parameter is included. Comments are no longer included with embedded views.\nTabadmin fills disk space with unnecessary temporary files each time it is used. This is especially a problem when using the tabadmin status command. This issue will be fixed in a future maintenance release.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Capabilities","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"7.0","ReleaseDate":"17/01/2012","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Capabilities"},{"entry":"Tableau 7.0 will empower you with new visualizations like filled maps and area charts.

For example, clearing \"False\" would filter the data but the quick filter would still show a check mark next to \"False.\" This issue has been corrected and the quick filter now correctly reflects the filter state.\nDual axis charts would attempt to align zeros even when the \"Include Zero\" option was not selected. This behavior has been changed to not align zeroes unless \"Include Zero\" is selected for both axes.\nProgress OpenEdge connections were not handling bit/boolean (logical) fields properly when using Custom SQL. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where views would not update after changing to a new user in the user filter. The workbook now updates correctly.\nWhen refreshing or removing an extract, which had previously been published to the data serve using embedded database credentials there were cases where it would not be able to complete the refresh of the extract. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a discrepancy in DATE_TRUNC functions results between a live Aster connection and working with an extract from an Aster database. The Aster database calculated dates with Monday as the first day of the week. Tableau uses Sunday as the first day. This difference is now accounted for when creating extracts from Aster.\nGroups and manual sort orders were not always maintained correctly when connecting to SQL Server databases. This issue has been corrected.\nEnabled a TDC customization for Oracle data sources, that allows you to set CAP_QUERY_SUBQUERY_QUERY_CONTEXT to avoid expensive queries involving temporary tables. You can learn about TDC customization in the Customizing and Tuning ODCB Connections article.\nSupport was added for the SQL Server 2012 driver.\nTableau Server\nPreviously, there were some issues with product keys sometimes appearing twice on the Licenses page. This has been fixed.\nCorrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.\nFixed an issue where pausing \"Automatic Updates\" on a published view, changing quick filters, then resuming the updates resulted in a blank view.\nThe --administrator option is one of the options you can use with the tabcmd syncgroup command. In earlier versions it assigned the Administrator user right to a group of users.

This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue where the Microsoft SQL Server name was limited to the size of the text box in the connect dialog box (roughly 30 characters).\nUsing a workbook that connects to an extract from a text file and has a calculated field could incorrectly cause an \"Ignoring calculated field\" error if a new calculated field with the same name is added to the extract.\nCorrected an issue with creating extracts from Hadoop Hive data sources with long character data.\nCorrected an issue creating a calculated field with a CASE statement that uses a parameter value in the formula.\nTableau Server\nCorrected a drawing issue on Internet Explorer 7 where compact quick filters would not initially draw the drop-down arrow control.\nWhen viewing a tabbed workbook, the size of all dashboards is now examined to determine the best size. Dashboards set to Automatic size are now considered to be the 'maximum' size, so a fixed size dashboard will not incorrectly constrain an automatic dashboard, which depends on the size of the browser window and can be bigger than the fixed size.\nCorrected a case where quick filters would erroneously display horizontally rather than vertically, causing scroll bars to appear.\nEmbedding a view into an iFrame and including ?:comments=yes was not displaying the comments area. This issue has been corrected.\nThe \"Run Now\" menu option for refreshing extracts wasn't showing for Content Administrators. This command is now correctly available.\nCustom shapes were lost when performing a scheduled incremental refresh of a workbook. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem where saving custom views via the Remember My Changes link would not always save the changes. This problem would occur when a workbook with a single view or dashboard was published to the server with the Show Views as Tabs option enabled.\nCorrected a problem introduced in version 6.1.4 where using a quick filter with the All option could cause the first click on an individual value in the list to deselect all other values.\nOptimized performance for servers that have a large number of scheduled jobs. The optimization trims completed job records from the metadata tables. The default behavior is to always remove completed job data older than 30 days. The number of days value can be set by the configuration parameter purge.jobs.retention_days.\nCorrected an error when creating PDF output for a view that uses a font that does not exist on the Tableau Server machine.\nCorrected an issue with certain quick filters and blank values in the display that would cause the view to not load on the iPad.\nCorrected an intermittent problem where quick filter titles could overlap the filter values.\nOptimized how permissions are set on members of a group. Previously the application could hit memory errors when changing permissions on a group with 30,000 members and take upwards of 12 minutes. The optimization now completes the task in 30 seconds and consumes minimal memory.\nCorrected a difference in how Desktop and Server handle filter actions when the filters were updating multiple views on a dashboard.

{"VersionNumber":"6.1.2","ReleaseDate":"15/09/2011","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nCreating an extract from a text file could cause an \"Invalid datetime value\" error when a Date/Time field contains number values that are not valid dates. The extract now completes as expected.\nWhen connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database, fields that contained decimal values would display as #Error in the view when the system locale did not match the database locale. These values are now displayed correctly.\nThe default name when creating a calculated field would not increment correctly causing duplicate name errors. The default name is now \"Calculation1\", \"Calculation2\", and so on.\nCorrected an issue where a workbook with large CASE statements in a calculated field would take substantially longer to open than in version 6.0.\nCorrected a case where creating a bar graph with all zero values would place the zero at the center of the axis and extend the bars to the bottom of the graph implying negative values.\nThe application would unexpectedly exit when opening specific workbooks that were not properly cleaned up when saved. This issue has been corrected.\nConnection names with a colon (:) in them would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit when creating an extract. The following characters are no longer allowed in connection names: * < > ? | / \\ :\nThe message \"measure expressions must be aggregate or depend only on group-by columns\" would needlessly display when editing certain Table Calculations. Dismissing the message would continue correctly. The message is no longer displayed in these cases.\nConnections to OData data sources was incorrectly converting periods (.) in column names into underscore characters, which made Tableau unable to retrieve the data. Tableau no longer converts characters in the column names.\nChanging the fiscal year start when connected to Microsoft Analysis Services databases would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when adding sheets to a dashboard.\nWhen using an ODBC connection, entering an incorrect password could cause certain connection attributes to reset, which would then cause connection problems. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected the problem of displaying the message \"Intermediate version has expired\" or \"Intermediate version expiring in x days\" when launching Tableau, which would not allow the application to proceed when expired.\nTableau Server\nTableau Servers deployed behind proxy servers or certain firewall configurations were not loading views to users on the outside network. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen a workbook scheduled for full and incremental refreshes was downloaded, the incremental refresh settings weren't retained. This issue has been corrected.\nIncremental scheduled refreshes would not update after a scheduled full extract refresh was run. This issue has been corrected.\nClearing the 'All' check box in a multiple value list Quick Filter now visually clears all the individual items. This behavior correctly matches Tableau Desktop.\nCorrected a case where multiple value list Quick Filters with the (All) option enabled would not resize correctly to account for the (All) member. This would result in a scroll bar for the list of items.\nTableau Desktop\nDatabases with bigint data types could cause problems when using Tableau datepart functions creating overflow conditions. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue with computing a median when using a Tableau Extract that would result in an error \"The data source returned more than one total for a set of data values.\"\nAdded a REPLACE() function for a number of data sources. This function will replace all instances of a set of characters with a different set of characters. For example REPLACE(\"Calculation\",\"ion\",\"ed\") = Calculated \nThis function is available when connected to Tableau Extracts, DB2, Firebird, Cache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Vertica, Aster nCluster, Greenplum, ParAccel, Progress OpenEdge and Sybase IQ, as well as any ODBC data source that supports the {fn REPLACE(..)} ODBC scalar function.\nLifted the requirement that Vertica drivers match the Vertica database version being connected to. This change now allows using a Vertica 4.1 driver to connect to both Vertica 5 databases and pre-4.1 databases.\nWorkbook and extract files that have a total of 260 characters or more in the combined file name and path cannot be published to Tableau Server. A warning message is now displayed when this limit is exceeded.\nCorrected several issues where importing a sheet from a Bookmark could then put the workbook into an unstable state that could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. The instability was created when mapping the data source from the bookmark into either existing or new data sources in the target workbook.\nCorrected a query error that could occur when using multiple tables and joins when connecting to Microsoft Access databases.\nWhen connecting to JET-based data sources (Excel, CSV, Access) column names with leading or trailing spaces could cause errors when selecting View Data. This issue has been corrected.\nParameter controls with the Float data type would not always show the last value in the range due to rounding precision. For example the parameter may be defined to go from 0.1 to 1.2 incrementing by 0.1. The max value displayed in the slider would be 1.1 instead of 1.2. This issue has been corrected and the full value range now is available.\nWhen using a multidimensional data source and exporting a dashboard to a PDF, the values in quick filters could appear as fully described member names rather than member values. This issue has been corrected.\nChanging the Compute Relative To setting for table calculations would revert to the original setting each time the calculation was edited. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen a worksheet has invalid fields on it (indicated by the red exclamation point), creating a new parameter or renaming a calculated field could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nEditing a set that was created from a single-level hierarchy in a cube data source would not show any values in the edit dialog. This issue has been corrected.\nSearching for a value in a set that was created from a single-level hierarchy in a cube data source now correctly performs the search.\nAn action on a dashboard that navigates to another dashboard with an empty sheet on it could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nAdded the ability to disable ODBC connection pooling via the Connection Customization facility. This is useful for certain ODBC drivers to avoid driver conflicts.\nCorrected a case where Tableau would not open a particular saved workbook, instead giving the message, 'Access violation - no RTTI data!'\nCorrected a security vulnerability where Tableau would load certain Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) from the directory the workbook is being opened from. The correction is to only load these DLLs from the directory where the Tableau application is installed.\nUsing an Extract and a DATETRUNC function could cause errors with Filter Actions. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau Server\nThe 'Run Now' command is now two individual options in the Full Refresh and Incremental Refresh drop down menus on the Tasks page for a workbook. This change lets you selectively trigger either type of refresh extract.\nCorrected a case where an action on a dashboard was triggering a filter and the mouse movement was simultaneously asking for a tooltip to display. In this case a \"Session Busy. Please retry later\" message was shown.\nPan and zoom gestures on mobile devices now require the filter permission to be active. They no long are enabled for just people with the default viewer permission.\nTableau Server relative date filters were showing the first day of the week as Monday, rather than Sunday. While the calculations were performed correctly, the display was wrong. The date filters are now displayed correctly with Sunday as the first day.\nThe CSV file created from the View Data toolbar button was not correctly handling carriage return characters in the data which would cause multiple rows in the output file. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen working with Custom Value List quick filters on the iPad, the view would not always update immediately after entering a value. Rather, it would update after the second value was entered. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue where exporting data as a CSV file from Tableau Server could cause the data rows to be repeated. This issue would happen when using a single view with multiple panes.\nCorrected the cause of 'Gdiplus err=2' and 'Gdiplus Err=3' messages which could occur with some Tableau Server views.\nCorrected a case where Tableau Server would display a blank or partially blank view. In this case, the server log files would show the entry 'Gdiplus error code is Invalid Parameter.'\nThe browser back button now correctly moves to prior tabs in a workbook if an action loads a new tab.\nA radio button single value quick filter could get into a state where none of the options are selected. This issue has been corrected.\nWildcard filters on a dashboard were not always including other global filters on sets. This issue has been corrected.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"6.1.2","ReleaseDate":"15/09/2011","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"Creating an extract from a text file could cause an \"Invalid datetime value\" error when a Date/Time field contains number values that are not valid dates.

{"VersionNumber":"6.1","ReleaseDate":"29/07/2011","ReleaseContents":"Tableau 6.1 is loaded with new features. We've added incremental updates, faster extracts, and for the first time, the Desktop application is available in French and German. We're also introducing Tableau for iPad. Tableau Server views are now optimized to deliver touch experiences when accessed on devices like the Apple iPad. These are all just the beginning of what's new in this version.\nSee what's new in Tableau 6.1 +\nSpecific corrections and improvements are listed below.\nTableau Desktop\nCorrected an issue where workbooks would continue to prompt for a password for Microsoft Access databases even when the password was removed on the database.\nCustom color palettes for quantitative color encoding, map data layers, and reference bands are now included in the workbook or bookmark so that the views look the same wherever they are opened (e.g., Server, other machines, etc.).\nWhen using Custom Value List and Wildcard Match quick filters, typing in all capital letters or all lower case letters performs a case insensitive search. Mixed case strings will rely on the underlying database for whether the search is case sensitive. This change also affects Search in quick filters.\nConnecting to an Analysis Services cube with the same level names in multiple hierarchies would not properly highlight selections when the same named level from the different hierarchies was added to the view.\nConnecting to an Analysis Services cube with the same level names in multiple hierarchies would not properly apply URL filters to the expected dimension.\nRemoving the last display of a hidden sheet now provides an option to either delete or unhide the sheet. Prior releases would simply warn it will be deleted.\nChanging the definition of a Table Calculation no longer resets the formatting and axis label customization previously made to the Table Calculation field.\nChanged the decimal rounding routines to be consistent. Prior to this change certain decimal values could be rounded down rather than up when truncating the display. For example 2.050000000000 could round to 2.0 rather than 2.1. \nBlending data from a relational source into a Microsoft Analysis Service cube could end up missing some values from the cube that actually exist. This has been corrected.\nA case was corrected where a dashboard with horizontal layout containers could go into a loop during the rendering process. The case was with a particular combination of sizes and blank areas inside the layout container.\nTableau bookmarks were not saving custom relationship settings used in data blending.\nHovering over a mark would not show the tooltip for the mark when the automatic updates setting was disabled. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen an axis in a scatter plot was clicked, it incorrectly triggered select actions for the marks in the view. This problem has been fixed.\nIf the output of a calculated field in a secondary data source was used as the linking field for data blending and was not included in the view itself, the view did not refresh automatically when edits were saved to the calculated field on the secondary connection. This issue has been corrected.\nModifying the relationship definition in data blending by removing a relationship did not automatically refresh the view. This has been corrected and now, when the relationship changes, the view is updated immediately.\nCorrected a case where Tableau was not properly disconnecting from Oracle Essbase databases.\nReplace References now correctly includes the replacement in bins, groups, relationship for data blending, and fields in calculations in secondary data sources.\nThere was an issue in which selecting multiple tabs in a workbook, using shift + select, then changing the Page Setup options resulted in an incorrect copy of the first sheet's Title and Caption to all the selected sheets. This issue has been corrected.\nImplemented a performance optimization when opening workbooks with more than 10,000 values in a color or shape encoding.\nImplemented a performance optimization when querying Tableau Extracts and using CASE statements.\nCorrected the geolocation of a number of elements, including zip codes 92376, 90275, and 90731, as well as a number of states and provinces across Eastern Europe and China.\nImproved the visual smoothness of animated playback when using the high speed playback option for complex or multi-pane views.\nOptimized queries against MySQL databases when one of the columns in the table was of an enum data type. Prior to this change, Tableau would needlessly include substring() functions around all string columns in the query, which could potentially impact performance.\na visual artifact that was incorrectly appearing as a small triangle off the coast of southern Australia.\nOptimized queries generated to Microsoft Analysis Services cubes when using slicing filters with the 'All' option selected.\nSubstitution variables for limits in titles were not correctly substituting the values. This has been corrected.\nAn 'Automatic' option was added to the Mark Halo color options. This allows the halo color to adjust automatically based on the background color of the underlying view. For example, with dark maps the halo color switches from white to black when automatic is selected.\nGeocoding data matches now are case-, accent-, and punctuation-insensitive. For example, \"Cordoba\", \"CORDOBA\" and \"CÓRDOBA\" all match.\nPreviously, hidden worksheets in dashboards did not re-hide themselves if you navigated from the hidden sheet to a different dashboard than where you started. This has been corrected and the sheets now always automatically re-hide themselves.\nMap labels for countries of Congo-Kinshasa and Congo-Brazzaville were reversed. This issue has been corrected.\nUsing Vertica 4.0 or higher now requires using a Vertica 4.0 or higher ODBC driver. This is because Tableau now supports the Vertica extended string syntax that was added in Vertica 4.0. Tableau recommends that you use the same version of Vertica ODBC driver and Vertica database. For example, if you have the 4.1 Vertica database, you should use the 4.1 driver; if you have the 4.0 database, use the 4.0 driver.\nWhen connecting to OData data sources, Tableau would not correctly read short date formats. This issue has been corrected.\nThe installer is now distributed as an .EXE file rather than as a .MSI.\nA problem was corrected where the substitution variable sometimes caused the error: \"Error parsing date '%s'\" This would only occur when the workbook was created on a computer with one locale (regional setting) and opened on a computer with a different locale.\nCorrected an issue that could cause Tableau Server to return the error \"Gdiplus error code is Invalid Parameter.\"\nTableau Server\nThe tabsvc.yml setting gateway.trusted is now automatically added to the gateway.trusted_hosts list. As a result, external proxy servers referenced by IP address in a user's browser will now correctly detect the IP address of the user's machine.\nTableau Server now displays the names of views, instead of titles, as their identifiers (e.g., in search results). Upgrade customers will keep the pre-6.1 behavior but can use the tabadmin command \"wgserver.show_view_titles_not_names\" to change it.\nViews can now be embedded into SharePoint in multi-domain Active Directory environments using trusted tickets.\nThe Apache web server provided in version 6.1 has been upgraded to version 2.2.17.\nSeveral issues have been resolved related to tabcmd accepting and processing unicode files.\nSearching workbooks within a selected project now displays results only from within that project.\nYou can now publish workbooks with extracts larger than 2 GB. Note that some limitations are imposed by Tableau Server timeout settings and how much free disk space is available.\nThe project formerly named \"default\" is now named \"Default\".\nSafari and Chrome web browsers have built-in spell checking for text boxes. In previous versions of Tableau Server, the username text box in the Login page would be spell-checked. This behavior has been disabled.\nThe Revert toolbar button restores the view back to the published or saved state.\nSeveral fixes have been made to improve the layout and rendering of server pages, including truncating names of groups, projects, workbooks, and views when the names are extremely long.\nWhen you look at your workbooks on the server in List mode, clicking on the right-most Tabs columns now sorts tabbed workbooks to the top of the list.\nThe Type column on the Data Sources page no longer appears to support sorting. In earlier versions, clicking on this column resulted in a server error.\nHierarchical filter names were being truncated if the name included a period. This issue has been corrected. \nSeveral optimizations have been made to handle temp files that result from an unexpected server shutdown. \nWhen a view's data was updated using the \"Refresh Data\" button, the timestamp for the update was not being refreshed. This problem has been corrected.\nPublished views using Compact List quick filters sometimes didn't correctly render the drop-down label or list contents for certain web browsers and operating systems, including Firefox on the Mac OS. This issue has been corrected.\nViews in your Favorites list now have icons.\nActive Directory groups whose names include the ampersand symbol (&) are now imported correctly.\nUsername links in the Server Activity views (which are really URL actions in the view) would result in a 'page does not exist' error if the username included multiple periods in the name (e.g. fname.lname@yourorg.com). This issue has been corrected.\nPublished views created with quick filters behaved differently depending on whether the data source was SQL Server or MSAS. This issue has been corrected.\nThere were some intermittent problems with filter performance when switching between dashboards. This has been fixed.\nYou can create a quick filter for a measure, then format the measure. For example, values appear as a percentage or currency. There was an issue where these formatted measures would display correctly in Tableau Desktop but would change to a decimal format once published to Tableau Server. This problem has been corrected.\nA problem was fixed related to high publishing volumes during the same or multiple server sessions.\nBrowser page titles (e.g., the name that's displayed in the tabbed pages of a web browser) have been changed. Now, browser page titles simply show the sheet name rather than having a preamble of Views: <sheetname> or Workbook: <workbookname>. This makes it easier to quickly pick the desired tab. In addition, the Tableau masthead area now shows the workbook name when displaying a tabbed view, or just the sheet name when displaying a single view.\nTableau Server session cookies are now protected with HTTPOnly and Secure flags, thus reducing the chance server sessions can be maliciously compromised.\nThe scripts dispatch.rb, dispatch.fcgi, and .htaccess were not being used by Tableau Server and are no longer installed.\nIn an earlier version, a date field created using a date hierarchy quick filter was truncated such that only the last three digits of the date displayed when the workbook was published. This problem has been corrected.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau 6.1 is loaded with new features.

{"VersionNumber":"6.0.8","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2011","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nViewing data for the entire view (no selected marks) would cause an \"Invalid field formula\" error. This issue has been corrected.\nExporting a crosstab to Excel now correctly exports the data from the current page based on the fields on the Pages shelf rather than exporting the entire sheet, which could cause data from other pages to show in the exported crosstab.\nSome table calculations would cause the error: \"The input to TOTAL() must be from a single datasource.\" The error was caused by how the calculation is broken apart in order to process the query. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application would occasionally hang when it lost connection to the data source. This was caused by multiple progress dialog boxes that would interfere with each other. This issue has been corrected.\nCreating an extract from a Vertica database could cause a COPY error. The error was caused by how Tableau was handling delimiter and escape characters when creating the extract. Tableau now follows the correct syntax in these cases.\nWhen creating an extract from an Oracle database, an \"Invalid datetime value\" error would occur when the underlying database contains datetime columns that cannot be translated. The extract will no longer fail in these cases. The columns will exist in the extract but the invalid datetimes will have the value \"Error.\"\nWhen running on Windows 7 and Windows Vista and working with TWBX files the application could unexpectedly exit when closing the file and cleaning up the temporary files. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau now correctly warns you that you cannot assign a measure value an alias that already exists in the database. Previously no warning would be given and the duplicate alias would be used until you closed and reopened the workbook, where the measure would revert to its original value.\nWhen using a quick filter on Measure Values, a calculated field that depends on a parameter would disappear from the quick filter when deselected. The calculated field now remains in the quick filter and is only removed from the view when deselected.\nThe application would unexpectedly exit when dragging a field to a legend (e.g., size, shape, color) while the Marks card is hidden. This issue has been corrected.\nPerforming a View Data with no values selected on a sheet that has a Table Calculation with a filter would show the message \"The underlying data cannot be retrieved for this visualization without a selection.\" This issue has been corrected and the View Data action is now performed.\nImproved logging so that all error messages are added to the log files along with any details and query information that is available.\nCorrected an issue where the vertical scroll bar would not always show in a dashboard view that contains many columns.\nThe application would unexpectedly exit when removing sheets from dashboards with synchronized page controls. This issue has been corrected.\nThe application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when refreshing an extract that was created from a local file data source that relied on the JET database engine (e.g., Excel, Access, Text files). The underlying problem was JET unexpectedly returned a NULL value for the data collation.\nWhen working with an MS Access 2010 database, a string comparison error, \"The parameter is incorrect.\" could occur. This error occurred when the locale on the machine did not match the locale set for the database. This issue has been corrected.\nImproved performance when creating new connections to Teradata databases.\nCorrected an error when connecting to Teradata databases using version 6.2 drivers.\nWhen connected to multidimensional databases, inserting a filter value from a slicing filter (a field that is otherwise not used in the view) into the title or caption would show the field name instead of the field value. This issue has been corrected and the field values are now inserted correctly.\nModified how connections to OData data sources collect metadata if the preferred technique fails. In these cases, Tableau falls back to validating a connection and then loading its metadata, which can be slower than the preferred method.\nConnections to OData data sources would only prompt for the Account Key. Tableau will now prompt for username and password when appropriate.\nThe application would exit unexpectedly when changing the data type for a field in Tableau where the underlying database has also had the datatype changed, making the field invalid. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a case where Tableau could unexpectedly exit if the datatype of a column used in a MDY calculation changed.\nUpdated the data used for geocoding zip codes.\nTableau Server\nExporting a PDF would show legends that were hidden when viewed on the server. This issue has been corrected.\nRefreshing an extract from a MySQL database would sometimes cause an invalid username and password error. These attributes are now set correctly for both built-in MySQL connections and connections using a generic ODBC driver.\nWhen publishing a workbook using the tabcmd utility, the sheets would be published in alphabetical order instead of the tab order in the workbook. This issue has been corrected and the sheets are now published in the order they are listed in the workbook.\nCorrected and issue where parameter controls would not always work the same on Tableau Server as they do in Desktop.\nAccessing the default Tableau Server Administrative Views would sometimes cause a server error. This was caused by an issue where there was an interruption retrieving images while loading the workbook.\nAdded an optional \"-n\" switch to the tabadmin ziplogs command for collecting netstat information along with the logs.\nCorrected several instances where Tableau Server, deployed behind a proxy server, returned pages with the actual hostname in the URL rather than the proxy server name.\nThe quick filter mode could not be changed between Include and Exclude on Tableau Server. Views were stuck with whatever mode that was published. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue where embedded views would intermittently become unresponsive. This issue was caused by a cache timeout that was not being handled properly and therefore preventing other requests.\nCorrected a rare case where a VizQL server processing multiple requests at the same time could cause a deadlock state between the requests and become unresponsive.\nCorrected a case where the server would become unresponsive and subsequently display \"503 could not establish session\" and \"Internal Server Error\" messages.\nFilter selections were not being saved with customized views (a change in 6.0.7 caused this). This has been corrected.\nImplemented a performance optimization for Tableau Server to not check for page titles and captions when the page shelf is not in use.\nBlocked access to some additional URLs on the server that are not part of the product functionality and were identified in an external security review as being inappropriately accessible.\nCorrected a case where embedded web pages on a dashboard could display an updated page in response to an action then quickly revert to the prior page.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"6.0.8","ReleaseDate":"23/06/2011","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"Viewing data for the entire view (no selected marks) would cause an \"Invalid field formula\" error.

{"VersionNumber":"6.0.5","ReleaseDate":"08/03/2011","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nAdded the ability to select a range of items on a shelf using shift + click. In prior versions, both ctrl-click and shift-click to would add the clicked item to the selection. Tableau now follows the Windows convention of using shift + click to select the range of items between an initial selection and the clicked item.\nThe data window no longer automatically scrolls the display to the far right to show the trailing characters of long column names. It now keeps the horizontal scroll to the left as the default.\nThe About screen that shows the Tableau build number now includes the more commonly used three-digit version number as well. For example, the About screen would include the version number 6.0.5. Tableau Server shows this version at the bottom of the sidebar.\nVersion 5 workbooks that use extracts and a grouping column on data that has a floating point datatype would get the error 'No such function' when opening in version 6. This issue has been corrected.\nAltered the way ODBC connect strings are created to avoid the error 'Format of the initialization string does not conform to the OLE DB specification.' This error was typically caused when a OLE DB connect attribute name conflicts with the underlying ODBC driver connect attribute name.\nWhen working with a dual axis chart and trend lines, removing the trend line from one of the axes would then show no text when selecting Describe Trend Model. This issue has been corrected.\nTurning off tooltips on multi-value sets now correctly removes the entries from the tooltip.\nImplemented a performance optimization for opening workbooks created in v5 with v6. This change affects only certain workbooks.\nWhen connecting to Vertica databases, if the database cannot be reached immediately (due to a network or database issue) Tableau now automatically retries the connection up to four times. Additionally, we have changed the timeout to detect a non-responsive server from a single attempt with a 60 second timeout to the four retries with a 15 second timeout.\nCorrected an issue that would occur when connecting to a Teradata database where the width of all rows in a table exceed 64k (32k for Teradata v6 database) which would cause the error \"Row size or Sort Key size overflow.\"\nWhen editing a parameter to change both the name and list of values, the change to values would be applied but not the change to the name. This issue has been corrected and changing them both at one time now works.\nWhen using a Fiscal Year start date other than Jan 1, calculations of Fiscal Quarters in a relative date filter were incorrect. This issue has been corrected.\nDateDiff() functions for quarter, month, week could in some cases return values off by one when connecting to GreenPlum, Sybase IQ, ParAccel, or Aster Data databases. The root issue was values truncating rather than rounding for partial periods. The calculations now round partial periods to return the correct results.\nWorking with a single level cube hierarchy, the compact list filter type was being displayed as a multi-select list (checkboxes) when exporting the view to a PDF.\nCorrected a problem when selecting marks with a field on the color shelf where not all the unselected marks would correctly fade their color. The underlying cause was colors whose RGB code is xxFFFF would not get faded correctly.\nWhen a worksheet does not have any measures in play, adding a background image could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nTooltips for data marks now correctly show labels for Null values.\nImporting a bookmark that includes a data source named the same as an existing data source would not overwrite the existing data source, even when the Rename option was selected. This issue has been corrected.\nOn complex dashboards, right-clicking a mark and selecting Format while other panes on the dashboard are still being updated could cause an error 'Edit interrupted'. This error has been corrected.\nConnecting to Text files and changing the character set option to 'Other' would prevent providing a connection name longer than 1 character in the connection dialog box. This issue has been corrected.\nImplemented an optimization when connecting to Vertica databases. In prior versions Tableau would detect and log information about Vertica projections. This detection could be time-consuming. This discover is no longer performed.\nImplemented an optimization when connecting to Vertica v4.0 or higher databases where we have a more efficient technique to discover available database views.\nImplemented an optimization when connecting to Vertica databases. In prior releases Tableau would issue additional metadata discovery queries to test columns to check if they were boolean. This check is now much more selective, and performed only when we see columns defined as char(1).\nImplemented a performance optimization when connecting to Vertica databases. Tableau now caches the database locale and does not repeatedly request it from the database.\nExtended connections to Vertica databases to support connection customization hints available via TDC files. Details on TDC customizations can be found in the Customizing ODBC Connections article. The customization hints made available for Vertica are: CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES & CAP_SKIP_CONNECT_VALIDATION.\nExtended connections to MySQL databases to support connection customization hints available via TDC files. Details on TDC customizations can be found in the Customizing ODBC Connections article. The customization hints available for MySQL are: CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES, CAP_SELECT_INTO, CAP_SELECT_INTO & CAP_QUERY_HAVING_REQUIRES_GROUP_BY (for InfoBright users).\nCorrected an issue when connecting to Teradata databases where selecting a table with referential integrity constraints could cause an error. The error would have included the text 'Blank name in quotation marks.'\nCorrected an issue with creating temporary tables when connected to Teradata databases. Tableau was incorrectly using != as a test of inequality rather than the Teradata syntax of <>.\nExtended connections to Teradata databases to support connection customization hints available via TDC files. Details on TDC customizations can be found in the Customizing ODBC Connections article. The customization hints made available for Teradata are: CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES & CAP_SKIP_CONNECT_VALIDATION.\nOn dashboards that connect to multiple data sources, adding a highlight action would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau Server\nEntering a value and then pressing enter into a custom value list quick filter could generate an error \"An unexpected error occurred on the server. If you continue to receive this error please contact your Tableau Server Administrator. Would you like to reset the view?\" Entering values into these lists now require you to press the plus icon (+) to add the value.\nUser and group names that match the search engine 'exclude' terms were not appearing in the lists of users/groups in the server interface. The initial report was for groups named IS and IT. The following words are now valid as user and group names: a an and are as at be but by for if in into is it no not of on or s such t that the their then there these they this to.\nSubstitution values for embedded web pages on a dashboard now correctly substitute Full Name, User Name, Sheet Name, and Workbook names.\nSelecting Revert All from the toolbar now reverts any highlighting of marks that were triggered by a highlight action.\nOptimized how backups are created when using the tabadmin backup command and cut the time to create the backup file significantly. This same optimization helps with the automatic backup that is performed when uninstalling Tableau Server prior to upgrading.\nCorrected an issue publishing workbooks that use the username() function for defining user filters. The error message you would see prior this change was 'Cannot evaluate user filter; no current user or group.'\nRemoving saved views (views saved be selecting 'Remember My Changes') would not actually remove the saved view on all browsers. This issue has been corrected.\nQuick filters displayed with the 'All' option could get into an unusual state where deselecting 'All' would leave all the individual items checked. This issue has been corrected.\nThe Export Data permission was incorrectly blocking the ability to create a PDF. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen connected to an Analysis Services cube data source, selecting the first item in a compact list quick filter was not applying the filter. This issue has been corrected.\nWorking with trusted tickets for authentication, when a view is accessed from a shared computer by an unlicensed user, any next valid user from the same machine would not be properly authenticated. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen working with trusted tickets for authentication, an unlicensed user would incorrectly be returned a view when requesting it.\nWhen working with Microsoft Analysis Services, using the download data option from the Server would duplicate all dimension columns in the resulting file. This issue has been corrected.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"6.0.5","ReleaseDate":"08/03/2011","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"Added the ability to select a range of items on a shelf using shift + click.

{"VersionNumber":"6.0.4","ReleaseDate":"01/02/2011","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nImproved the experience when working with multiple connections in a workbook that point to the same extract file. When duplicating a connection that uses an extract we now also make a copy of the extract. For workbooks that are upgraded from prior versions we now ensure the multiple connections are aware that the extract may have already been upgraded.\nAdded support for working with Excel files where the column heading names have leading or trailing spaces as part of the name. The extra spaces are now ignored by Tableau. Previously when a column had a leading or trailing space it would get the error 'Database error 0x80040E10: No value given for one or more required parameters.\"\nWhen a sheet on a dashboard becomes invalid, usually because a field on the sheet becomes invalid, the Title of the sheet would show as blank and the 'go to' button would look active but not take you to the sheet. The title now appears and the 'go to' button is now active.\nThe option to synchronize axes when the values on the axes are different datatypes has been disabled. Prior to this change the menu was available but did nothing when selected. To synchronize axes, they need to have the same datatype.\nCorrected an issue when creating a Tableau Extract where the error 'Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: HashGrouping::InsertHash: collisions = ...\" could be encountered.\nCorrected an issue when using JET-based connections (Excel, text files, Access databases) that would cause the error: 'Microsoft JET database error 0x80040E14: Join expression not supported. Unable to calculate the sort for the field . The display may not show correct data.'\nImplemented a performance optimization where we no longer query for the full list of possible values when a quick filter is set to be a wildcard filter. For very large databases this unnecessary query could be very time consuming.\nImplemented a performance optimization when working with a Tableau Extract and the Total() table calculation.\nCorrected a case where opening a workbook with a very large number of worksheets (over 250 worksheets) would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. The application was running out of Windows resources with this many worksheets.\nIteratively selecting marks and excluding them when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube was not keeping the 'prior' excludes. This behavior has been corrected.\nCorrected the SQL generated when using grouping columns so it no longer creates needlessly long running queries compared to prior versions of Tableau.\nTableau no longer unexpectedly exits when opening certain bookmark files that reference Tableau extracts.\nOptimized performance by using more efficient database queries when using relative date filters.\nWhen connected to a Tableau Extract, changing the datatype of a field from 'string' to 'date' now correctly converts the dates.\nFor fields that have exclude filters defined, right-clicking a label and selecting 'Keep Only' would incorrectly exclude the selection. The selections are now correctly kept in the view and all others are excluded.\nCorrected an issue where a filter action could inadvertently change the filter type on other quick filters (e.g., change the filter type from multiple value list to custom value list).\nRemoved the dialog box that stated 'The connection to the database was successful.' when creating a new connection. Removing this dialog box make the connection process more efficient by eliminating the extra click required to dismiss it.\nAdded a new tab located on the right side of the worksheet tabs along the bottom of the workbook. Clicking this tab that will create a new worksheet.\nMade resizing and moving panes on a dashboard easier. An active pane on a dashboard can now be resized vertically by clicking and dragging on the top blue header area. Prior releases required a more precise click on the area just above the blue header. The expanded area for clicking makes resizing easier. To move the dashboard zone you now drag it by selecting the 'gripper' in the middle of the header area.\nWhen connecting to a cube data source (Analysis Services or Essbase), calculations using local functions such as USERDOMAIN() AND USERNAME() to get values from a Tableau Server connection would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.\nUsing the DATEDIFF() function to calculate the difference in number of Quarters when using a Tableau Extract was incorrect.\nWhen running Tableau on Windows XP and connecting to Teradata databases, table names longer than 30 characters could not be seen. This issue has been corrected.\nTableau now correctly geocodes the 'Australian Capital Territory' when creating a map.\nTableau Server\nOn Tableau Servers with multiple machines in the configuration (i.e., you have Worker machines as part of your deployment) processing scheduled tasks are now distributed across all nodes that have a VizQL server process running on them. In many scenarios this change can help with overall throughput of the schedule.\nImages on the toolbar could have extra pixel artifacts around them when viewed with a browser zoom larger than 100%, which occurs most frequently when using Safari on the iPad.\nSelection and highlighting has been added to the state saved by Remember My Changes. Additionally, these features are restored to the view's initial state when selecting Original View.\nRelative date quick filters displayed in the Browse Period mode, would show white borders around the options when placed on a non-white background. These extra borders have been removed.\nUsing the 'download' link for an embedded view that is served from an SSL-enabled Tableau Server would generate an error. This issue has been corrected.\nWorksheets with Unicode characters in the name now correctly display the Share and Download links when viewed on Tableau Server.\nCorrected a problem that was displaying the error message: 'Could not find FieldNameIdentifier for \"\".\" This problem was related to legends (color or size) being removed from dashboards.\nWhen viewing a customized view (saved by Remember My Changes), removing that customized view now returns you to the original view rather than remaining on the customized version.\nCorrected an issue when URL parameters are passed and the next request includes either malformed parameters or does not include any URL parameters the server could become unresponsive or incorrectly return the previous view.\nWhen using a slider quick filter, the display format of the values shown on the slider was not correctly showing negative numbers. For example entering -365 would correctly set the filter to -365, but the value display on the slider control was losing the negative sign. These values are now displayed correctly.\nThe slider on the Page control had a white border around it when displayed on a dashboard with a non-white background. This issue has been corrected and the region around the slider is drawn as transparent so the background color displays properly.\nRemoving the title on the Page card would result in the Page card not appearing on the dashboard when it was published to Tableau Server. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen using a Tableau Server configured for trusted authentication, displaying a tabbed workbook now correctly allows navigation between the tabs. Prior to this correction it would incorrectly display the message, 'Your session has expired. Do you want to login again?'\nThe command, 'tabcmd syncgroup', was incorrectly reporting the status of unsuccessful syncs as successful. This command now correctly reports success and failure.\nWhen using tabcmd to retrieve pdf or png versions of a view, any user filters defined in the view were not correctly applied. The user filters worked fine when accessing the view via the Tableau Server interface, but not when using tabcmd. This issue has been corrected.\nActions that are defined to appear in the tooltip menu would not always appear. The tooltip menu was suppressed from displaying when the full text of the item is visible on screen and the tooltip would have simply repeated that text. The tooltip now appears in this case when there are Actions defined.\nPasting values from the clipboard into a custom value list quick filter would not work when using an Internet Explorer browser. These quick filters now behave correctly.\nRunning the command, 'tabadmin backup,' on a server with the extract engine distributed onto a second machine would not properly include the extract data in the backup. This issue has been corrected.\nThe web interface for changing permissions would fail on servers configured to use SSL because it was not using HTTPS on the request. This issue has been corrected.\nThe embed code generated by the Share button now correctly generates codes for views accessed when using trusted ticket authentication.\nCorrected an issue where publishing a view with certain quick filters could cause an error. The error message is: 'Unexpected Server Error. This view cannot display because the domain for one of the filters could not be identified.'\nURLs generated that include field names now encode the bracket [] characters.\nUsing the Data Connections page to update the attributes of a connection (for example to change the database server name) would not properly update TWBX files. Updating would cause the error, 'Uncaught error: An unexpected error occurred opening the packaged workbook.' This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected one cause of the error 'Session Ended by Server: An unexpected error occurred on the server...'. This correction is related to using Keep Only on certain views where the data column in the view may have changed on the database.\nRemember My Changes now remembers the values of parameters.\nRemember My Changes now remembers the values of filters set by actions.\nWhen using trusted authentication between a web application and Tableau Server, redeeming a second trusted ticket from the same machine would not fully reset the session for the second ticket, which could cause incorrect reuse of cached data, views, or filters.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"6.0.4","ReleaseDate":"01/02/2011","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"Improved the experience when working with multiple connections in a workbook that point to the same extract file.

{"VersionNumber":"6.0.2","ReleaseDate":"15/12/2010","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nSelecting Export > Data when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube database could export duplicate columns of data. This issue has been corrected.\nThe View Data command now correctly displays results when a pie chart has no fields on both the Row and Column shelves.\nWhen using table calculations, exporting to crosstab or duplicating a sheet as a crosstab could result in a crosstab with 100% in all cells. The problem occurs when fields are used on the color or size shelf that would be auto-added to the crosstab.\nTooltips for wide entries in the color legend would sometimes block the ability to select the entry and enable highlighting. The click now correctly passes through the tooltip to select the entry in the color legend.\nThe plus and minus (+/-) indicators for drilling up and down dates and hierarchies would not be active when field labels for rows were hidden. The +/- indicators have been moved to display in the top row of data when the field labels are hidden.\nDashboards where the Use as Filter option is set so one sheet filters the others would not always remember the state of the filter when the workbook is first opened. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue when clicking the undo button after grouping members together would sometimes cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when you add views to a dashboard that all use the same data source but different filters.\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit if a field on the Level of Detail shelf is filtered and ends up with no rows.\nCorrected an issue where changing a compact quick filter from Show All Values to Show Fewer Values could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nHidden fields were appearing in the automatic data relationships dialog box. This issue has been corrected and the hidden fields are no longer included in the relationship dialog.\nTableau Reader was allowing dashboard zones to be closed. It should not have allowed this.\nTableau Reader was displaying the 'Go to Sheet' button in a dashboard zone title, which could be used to go to a hidden sheet. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem that was causing a particular large workbook to not be able to open. The workbook had over 30 views in it, all arranged on a set of dashboards.\nTableau could unexpectedly exit when connecting to an OData data source and the number of columns returned changes mid-way through the connection. If additional columns start appearing mid-retrieval from an OData data source they are now ignored.\nSynchronizing dual axis charts when the axis is using a logarithmic scale now works correctly.\nWhen you add multiple sheets that use the Pages shelf to a dashboard, then remove the fields from the Pages shelves the application could unexpectedly exit when you switch back to the dashboard, select the now empty page control on the dashboard and select Synchronize. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen working with an existing sheet that has data blended from multiple data sources, selecting 'Show Me' could in certain cases cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nThe lower part of descenders on text characters (like the bottom of the letter g) are now no longer clipped by a pixel when publishing a view to a PDF file.\nCustom Value List filters and Wildcard match filters now work correctly when the search string includes apostrophes (e.g., O'Leary).\nContext menu items for Create Primary Group and Edit Primary Aliases were incorrectly available when working with a multidimensional (cube) data source. Selecting these options would cause an error. These menu items are now hidden for cube sources.\nCorrected an issue that was displaying the error 'Invalid datetime value' when opening a particular version 5 workbook with version 6.\nWhen using Analysis Services databases, adding trend lines for a categorical axis, extending the axis range to project further to the right would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This has been corrected and trend lines for cubes can be projected to future periods.\nImplemented a number of changes to the memory utilization checks, which were over aggressively reporting low memory conditions. These checks are now more accurate and will reduce the frequency of false-positive warnings about low memory.\nA calculation built from two table calculations now correctly honors the 'running' direction for the resulting calculation.\nUsing parameters in custom formulas in the filter dialog (for example to use a parameter to control the number of Top N items to display) could cause the filter to not be recognized as valid when opening the saved workbook. This issue has been corrected.\nImplemented an optimization for Vertica v4 connections where the way Tableau creates temporary tables includes \"unsegmented all nodes\" on the temporary table definition, which results in the temporary table being available on every node in a Vertica cluster.\nRefreshing an extract now also optimizes the extract.\nImplemented a performance optimization when working with Tableau Extracts and performing exclude filters.\nCorrected a case when using the data blending feature where Tableau could unexpectedly quit when running low on system memory.\nUsing an advanced Table Calculation function could cause the application to unexpectedly exit when toggling the options to Show Mark Labels.\nCorrected a problem where refreshing an extract after the underlying database schema has changed would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.\nIn certain cases the last pixel of certain annotations could get clipped. This issue has been corrected.\nWhen working on a non-English operating system and working with double-byte data, certain text characters would cause the application to unexpectedly exit when there were hyphenated words in the display (e.g., in annotation and captions).\nWhen working with an OData data source, the data in the workbook could not be refreshed to access updated data from the OData feed if some of the columns in the data window were hidden. This issue has been corrected.\nParameter controls are now correctly displayed when the sheet or dashboard is published to a PDF file.\nWhen a workbook is first saved on a machine where the operating system is using a locale that supports extended character sets (such as special accent marks) and then opened on a machine using a different locale that doesn't support those same extended character sets, the application would unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected and the workbook can be opened using any locale (although the extended characters may not display correctly).\nImplemented a number of performance optimizations in the Tableau extract files.\nCorrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when combining multiple sheets that use a cube data source onto a dashboard and turning on the 'Use as Filter' option.\nQuick filters set to a Custom Value List would not get any formatting changes cleared when selecting the Clear button from the bottom of the Format window. This issue has been corrected.\nIn Tableau Reader, the F10 key now correctly toggles the pause/resume automatic updates command.\nCorrected a case where an 'Unhandled Exception' error was displayed when publishing a particular workbook to Tableau Server.\nCorrected a case where publishing a workbook to Tableau Server that contains a quick filter with several hundred thousand items in the list would cause a C++ runtime error.\nCorrected a problem when using version 6.0 to open a workbook created with v5. The message displayed was: 'Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: No such function (iif boolean string integer).' These workbooks now open correctly.\nCorrected a case where synchronized page cards on a dashboard could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nCreating two parameters and naming them both the identical name which includes a blank space as the last character (for example: 'mango ') would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.\nQuick filters on columns whose names include square brackets [] would cause an error. This issue has been corrected.\nCalculated field that use the IIF function to compare a string column where the first few characters of the comparison were actually numbers could perform incorrect comparisons. This issue has been corrected.\nDATETIME columns now work correctly when using them for data blending.\nCorrected an \"Unhandled Exception\" that occurred after first editing a data connection and then renaming a field.\nHiding a row with all NULL values would also incorrectly hide the grand totals row.\nTableau Server\nSearch strings on the users and groups administrative pages now have an implicit asterisk wildcard character (*) automatically added to the end of non-quoted search strings. This provides for a more expected set of search results. For example, searching for Pat will now search for Pat*, while a search for \"Pat\" will be restrictive and search for only the three letter match.\n'Save My Changes' to create customized views of a dashboard could cause the browser to become unresponsive if the some of the sheets in the original workbook are renamed and then republished. This non-responsiveness has been corrected.\nTableau Server type-in parameters were not auto-completing when you've typed in a unique prefix to one entry. Auto-completion has been implemented now. For example, in a list of U.S. State names, typing Ari will auto-complete the entry with Arizona.\nIn the Tableau Desktop dialog box for importing workbooks or data sources from the server, optimized how lists of items are returned from the server.\nWhen using the 'By Publisher,' 'By Project,' and other 'By ...' links to filter lists of workbooks or views, the Quick Filter page lists the names of the Publishers, Projects, etc. and in parenthesis the number of related items. The page was incorrectly showing the complete number of workbooks in the group regardless of permissions. This number now correctly reflects the number of items you have permission to access rather than the total number.\nEmbed codes created on the Share dialog when invoked from something other than the first tab in a tabbed workbook view could embed the first tab rather than the active tab.\nCorrected a case where Tableau Server would return the error: \"private method 'split' called for nil:NilClass.\"\nCorrected a problem using the type-in search filter when accessing the server from Safari on an iPad.\nCorrected a problem that required clicking twice on menus and quick filters when accessing the server from Safari on an iPad.\nCorrected a display problem on type-in filters when accessing the server using Safari on an iPad.\nTableau Server could go unresponsive when multiple sessions were accessing the same database connection that is using the 'Other Databases (ODBC)' connection type.\nCorrected a problem where Tableau Server would get an error when displaying a view. The error message was: syntax error on line 30, col -1: `</p>. This error has been corrected and the views now open correctly.\nSearching for data sources by Tag now works.\nFilters and quick filters when using JET-based connections (Excel, Access, Text files) could display duplicate entries in the list of available values. This issue has been corrected.\nSeveral updates to the tabcmd documentation.\nTooltips would not display for workbooks that were created and published with version 5. This issue has been corrected. Make sure to clear the browser cache to see this correction.\nCorrected an issue where a Tableau Server process would become unresponsive and cause a users' session to time out. When the browser is refreshed, the user could incorrectly pick up another user's session.\nAdded the ability for an administrator to rename a group and successfully synchronize with Active Directory groups that have been renamed. When the AD group name changes, edit the group on the Administrator > Groups page on Tableau Server and then synchronize the group.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"6.0.2","ReleaseDate":"15/12/2010","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"Selecting Export > Data when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube database could export duplicate columns of data.

{"VersionNumber":"5.2","ReleaseDate":"15/06/2010","ReleaseContents":"In Tableau 5.2, weÃŒve added native connectivity for four data sources and provided support for hundreds of other connections with an ODBC connector. We've also updated the default map style with new font treatments and subtle changes to the colors used for water, land, parks and urban areas. As an alternative to the default maps, Tableau 5.2 has a second map style. Finally, the new maps include increased depth coverage for zooming into all parts of the world.\nSee what's new in Tableau 5.2 +\nBelow is a more detailed list of corrections in Tableau 5.2.\nTableau Desktop\nWhen importing custom geocoding values, Tableau now automatically treats all integer values as dimensions for the geocoding data. This treatment it easier to use custom geocoding files that include values such as Store_ID for the unique identifier.\nThe data layer on the Map Options card has been renamed from CMSA to CBSA. CMSA is the Core Metropolitan Statistical Area, which was replaced in 2003 by the CBSA, which is the Core Based Statistical Area. The data points and map boundary & labels were always CBSA data. Tableau originally named the data layer incorrectly.\nAlong with the updates to the map visual styles, the built-in geocoding data has been updated to correct a number of problems with incorrect placement of some zip codes, area codes, and country names.\nOptimized performance when connecting to Netezza databases, specifically related to sending metadata queries that include a \"limit 1\" in the SQL. These queries now use \"limit 0\" for these metadata discovery queries.\nAdded an option to \"Remove Reference Line\" to the context menu (right-click) menu for an axis that has one or more references lines.\nCorrected a query error that occurred when using Essbase utility dimensions and continuous dates.\nCorrected an issue where editing the connection for multiple joined text files could inadvertently remove the joined files from the definition.\nRunning the Tableau installer to repair an installation was not correctly associating the file associations with the 'repaired' version. The repair function in the installer now correctly assigned filetypes to open with the correct version of Tableau.\nBar charts drawn with negative values that extend either to the left or below the 0 line would sometimes have a small 1 pixel gap between the 0 line and the start of the bar. This drawing error has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue when using Tableau date functions and WEEK with Teradata databases.\nWhen using the zoom toolbar option, clicking one of the zoom levels in the drop-down control would zoom to an incorrect level. Clicking on a specific step now zooms to that correct level.\nCorrected an problem when connecting to a Navteq WMS server.\nTableau Server\nA Tableau Server installed behind a reverse proxy now correctly accesses the pages to set permissions on a workbook.\nIf publishing a workbook to Tableau Server fails it could leave partial workbook fragments on the server, which would appear in the list of workbooks but not open correctly. Tableau Server now ensures the workbook publishes correctly before making any of the views available in the workbook list.\nOn a dashboard with embedded web content, a filter action that targets a different view or dashboard in the workbook would not correctly open in a new window. Rather it would load the target view into the existing web container on the original dashboard. These actions now open the target view in a new window as expected.\nA confusing and inaccurate message was returned to people without an active account (an unlicensed user) on Tableau Server The message has been updated to be more relevant and understandable.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"In Tableau 5.2, weÃŒve added native connectivity for four data sources and provided support for hundreds of other connections with an ODBC connector.

{"VersionNumber":"5.1.2","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nRight-click menus would sometimes show Actions that were not appropriate for the selection. For example, with two dimensions on the rows shelf and a filter action defined for each dimension, right-clicking the outer dimension values should show both actions because selecting the outer field implicitly selects the inner field.\nWhen connected to an MSAS data source and the Hide Empty Rows option is deselected (off), placing the measure names field on the rows shelf would incorrectly always hide the empty rows. These empty rows now correctly honor the Hide Empty Rows option.\nTableau 5.0 would ignore invalid calculated fields in the Data Window (indicated by an exclamation mark) when creating or refreshing an extract. Tableau 5.1 would not create or refresh the extract until the invalid calculated field had been corrected. The v5.0 behavior was restored, and it now simply ignores these fields when creating the extract.\nWhen connected to an MSAS data source, a context filter and a top 10 filter on fields from the same hierarchy now correctly calculates the top 10.\nThe error report upload capability would create files with the completion status of the upload process. These files were not being removed properly once the upload was complete.\nTableau products running with a Trial License could not access WMS map servers. The option was incorrectly hidden from the Background Maps menu. The WMS option now appears for Trial users.\nCopying the trend model description, which is displayed in the Describe Trend Line dialog box, and pasting it into an Annotation, Caption, Title, or Tooltip would cause the application to unexpectedly quit.\nTableau would unexpectedly exit if one of the file names stored in the most recently used list on the Start page was saved incorrectly. This has been corrected.\nRefreshing an extract when the database no longer contains the column that a Tableau filter is defined on could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.\nWhen working with an MSAS database, the data retrieved by the View Data option now returns data values from related dimensions rather than just the key values from the related dimensions. Tableau now uses the MSAS RETURN CAPTION() clause, which substantially improves the usefulness of the data returned.\nTableau Reader could not access certain WMS servers to display maps. This issue has been corrected.\nCorrected an issue where excluding data values while using Table Calculations would sometimes display values incorrectly.\nAll connections to Vertica databases now automatically set the ODBC connection to read-write mode (specifically ReadOnly=0). This change allows certain Tableau features to work when the default driver settings are set to readonly. Permissions on the Vertica database are still enforced to control writing to the database.\nVertica connections are now created with the transaction isolation level set to Read Committed. Prior versions of Tableau set this option to Serializable. Read Committed may provide increased performance as it allows read-oriented queries such as Tableau's to execute concurrently with write-oriented processes such as data loads on the server.\nTableau Server\nFixed an issue that was causing \"No license found; Session creation failed.\" errors from Tableau Server. Additional logging was added to help isolate further causes of this infrequent error.\nThe link for Pause Automatic Updates has been changed from a text link in the upper right corner of the view to an icon on the toolbar. The icon was added to resolve a number of sizing issues when the view was scaled to a narrow size and to maintain consistency with the other toolbar commands. The new icon is the second from right on the toolbar, and toggles to indicate whether automatic updates are paused.\nQuick Filters on attribute dimensions now include the (All) option. Existing workbooks need to be republished and the Internet Explorer cache may need to be cleared to reflect this change.\nFilter actions were not applied correctly when following links between views on Tableau Server if the target view required a database login. This problem has been corrected and the filter values now properly pass to the target view.\nHiding a member of a set and then turning on totals would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This problem has been corrected.\nThere were times when clicking Refresh Data would not correctly update the view until some other change was made to the display (like modifying a filter). This has been corrected, Refresh Data will immediately update the view with the current data.\nCorrected an issue where configuring Tableau Server to use MySQL as the extract engine would cause the configuration tool to unexpectedly exit.\nThe relative date filter dialog box on Tableau Server sometimes displayed incorrect dates in the preview area even though the actual filter was applied correctly. The preview area display has been corrected.\nWorkbooks with embedded passwords that are attached to scheduled extracts could fail after the first scheduled run. This problem has been corrected.\nCorrected one cause of the server returning 'Session busy' messages. This correction is related to an action filter request working to update the view while a request for a tooltip is triggered from the pre-updated display. If the action ends up filtering out the data point for which the tooltip is requested, a Session Busy error could occur.\nURL parameters could set fields with user filters to be null, bypassing the automatic data restriction. This problem has been corrected.\nEmbedded views were sizing a bit differently than in version 5.0. Fixed size dashboards created in version 5.0 that would not display scroll bars in the embedded <iframe> region would sometimes get additional padding around the view which would cause the <iframe> to show scroll bars in version 5.1. This issue has been corrected and the views now size the same in version 5.1 as they did in 5.0.\n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"Tableau Desktop","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"5.1.2","ReleaseDate":"08/04/2010","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Tableau Desktop"},{"entry":"Right-click menus would sometimes show Actions that were not appropriate for the selection.

Unable to properly calculate the domain for the field 'column name'. Displayed data may be incorrect.\" The issue was related to a collation difference between the original database and the Tableau extract engine.\nAdded support for Vertica 3.0. Also now support connections to views in Vertica databases.\nRotating text when using Japanese, Chinese, or Korean characters no longer cuts off the last character.\nMade improvements to completely clean up temporary files when the application closed.\nOpening a workbook that contains groups would sometimes fail when the underlying data used in the groups have changed. Tableau now warns of this condition and opens the workbook.\nUpdated the Oracle drivers that are redistributed by Tableau to version 10.2.0.4. The new drivers correct a number of issues, most notably with connecting to 64-bit Oracle servers. Tableau Server includes the drivers in the installer; drivers for Tableau Desktop are available on the Download Drivers page.\nSome views and dashboards published to a PDF file would print at reduced quality from what was shown on the screen. This has been corrected.\nIn version 5.0, Tableau began creating tables rather than temporary tables for some tasks to correct an issue caused by certain restrictions with MySQL temporary tables. Tableau no longer creates tables in the cases where the person has 'create table' permission but does not have the database permission to drop those tables.\nDomain values for quantitative filters now compute more efficiently.\nAdded additional automatic reconnect logic for Microsoft Analysis Services connections when the database drops the connection.\nInteger fields may now be used as latitude & longitude for geographic roles.\nCorrected case where using a quick filter on a dashboard for a field that no longer exists in the database would cause Tableau to abruptly exit when opening the dashboard.\nMark label drag handles (yellow diamonds) are once again drawn correctly when a label is selected.\nSelecting Refresh Extract after changing the default aggregation for a measure in the Data window would not use the new aggregation. Tableau now correctly recognizes the change.\nWhen connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database, single-member slicing filters now correctly filter to a single member rather than the entire hierarchy.\nCreating a Tableau Extract would truncate some characters from Japanese strings. This has been corrected.\nCertain Oracle queries using Case or If statements would generate an Oracle error \"ORA-12704: character set mismatch\". The issue was related to certain data types and collations.\nCorrected a problem when creating an extract that would result in some filters returning no values. The issue was related to a collation difference between the original database and the Tableau extract engine.\nTableau Server\nTableau Server views embedded into another application would not display in Internet Explorer when the other application & Tableau Server were installed on computers in different domains. This has been corrected.\nSimplified the syntax required for passing URL filters to views built from cube datasources (MSAS & Essbase). The original syntax required each filter to provide a fully qualified definition (such as [Country].[State].[City]=[Country].[State].&26[Seattle]). The new streamlined syntax is to simply provide a name=value pair. For hierarchies a name=value for each higher level of the hierarchy does need to be provided. An example of the new syntax would be: Country=US&State=WA&City=Seattle\nWorkbooks with a scheduled extract that make use of the User Filters capability now correctly work on Tableau Server. When the scheduled extract is run, it performs the query as the username of the person that originally published the workbook.\nCertain long-running tabcmd commands may reach a timeout before completion. A new option has been added to the tabcmd utility to specify a longer timeout setting. The timeout setting may now be extended with the new global option: --timeout seconds (where \"seconds\" is the number of seconds before time out) to the end of any tabcmd command.\nWhen a Microsoft Analysis Services cube is rebuilt, if the structure of the cube changes, MSAS will disconnect all sessions that are open to it. This causes Tableau sessions to be disconnected. Any open Tableau Server view will get a message from MSAS that states \"Current session is no longer valid due to structural changes.\" Tableau now does not display this message and will automatically reconnect to the database to display the view.

{"VersionNumber":"5.0.1","ReleaseDate":"01/07/2009","ReleaseContents":"Tableau Desktop\nAdded logic to specifically set Sunday as the first day of a week for date calculations when working with SQL Server databases.\nWhen connected to a Teradata data source, Tableau now limits the number of columns included in the index of temporary tables to avoid surpassing the Teradata limit.\nCorrected an issue where time values would not be included with Date columns when creating extracts from an Oracle data source.\nDashboard quick filters and legends now use the Default Worksheet font (Format > Font). This change is particularly useful for Asian languages where the filters and legends were not being drawn in unicode-aware fonts.\nAdded the ability to 'Revert to Saved' when working with Packaged Workbooks (TWBX). This command is also now enabled in Tableau Reader.\nExporting worksheets to PDF would sometimes clip the right border of the right-most item on the page. This has been corrected.\nRemoved delay when using the \"other\" option to specify the field delimiter for text files. The text box to specify an \"other\" character now displays immediately.\nOptimized performance for text file data sources that use sets to filter a view by excluding the members of the set.\nCorrected problem computing confidence intervals or standard deviation reference lines on a per-pane basis when one of the panes has no values.\nFor Teradata data sources, fixed SQL query errors in operations on mixed DATE/DATETIME data types.\nCorrected a problem with the SQL generated when working with Oracle databases and certain complex calculated fields.\nThe message \"The custom geocoding directory c:\\Program Files\\Tableau\\Tableau 5.0\\local\\data\\ has errors.\" would sometimes incorrectly appear when opening views. This has been corrected.\nAdded additional checks at application shutdown for completely cleaning up temporary files created by Tableau.\nNamed Pipe connections are now only created when needed by the application. Pre-creating this type of connection would sometimes cause the following error message: \"UniquifyForUser failed to get unique name size, code 14.\"\nImproved anti-aliasing for font sizes greater than 48 points.\nEditing Actions that were created as sheet links in previous versions no longer causes the application to fail.\nFixed problem where selecting Window > Cascade in a workbook with a large number of sheets would freeze the application.\nCorrected a filtering problem when using a count or count distinct function on a column with a very long name.\nWhen using Microsoft Analysis Services data sources and MSAS remote sets in a Tableau filter, you could get a message about \"The definition of the set contains a circular reference.\" This has been corrected.\nCorrected a problem with converting number fields to dates after creating an extract from a data source that uses Microsoft Jet. The resulting date would be off by 2 days due to a discrepancy between the Jet and Tableau definitions of \"day 0.\"\nAction filters now display in alphabetical order on tooltips.\nPublishing a dashboard to a PDF would sometimes truncate the text in color legends, even when the space on the dashboard was manually sized to show the full text values.\nCorrected an infrequent error when creating a URL action that uses field values as parameters in the url.\nThe application now always considers Sunday as the first day of the week. This fixes week boundary calculations that would sometimes break on Monday.\nWorkbooks using extracts and calculated field definitions that are over 64k in size could garble the data model when loading. This has been corrected.\nTableau Server\nUsing prompted logon for Analysis Services views (as opposed to having the Tableau Server logon as its 'runas' identity) would not correctly reconnect when the user selected to 'remember my password'. This now works correctly.\nTooltips now display when viewing Tableau Server administrative views.\nExporting images, data, data as cross-tab, or PDF files from Tableau Server now displays a status window while generating the file. Once the file is ready, a link is provided to download it.\nGlobal filters on embedded views now properly update with values passed in the URL.\nTableau Server does not support filter or highlight actions that use the \"All Fields\" option and point to a sheet that is not shown on the current page. These actions are now hidden from the tooltip for menu actions and silently ignored for hover and selection actions. In prior versions these actions would display an error.\nOn some systems Tableau Server would stop responding to requests after an initial few would succeed.

{"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"24/09/2008","ReleaseContents":"New Features\nWeb Map Service (WMS) Support\nTableau 4.1 adds Web Map Service (WMS)support so you can retrieve custom maps from your own WMS servers. While the Tableau Online and Offline maps were carefully designed to display data effectively and beautifully for all kinds of data, the WMS support allows you to use Tableau with specialized maps that are custom to your organization. There are some public WMS servers available as well as a number of WMS enabled server products your organization may already have such as software from ESRI, MapInfo, or others. \nTableau supports servers that have implemented the WMS 1.1.1 specification. You can download a quick start guide with step-by-step instructions for using a WMS server in Tableau 4.1 from the Quick Start Guides page. \nActive Directory Improvements\nIf you use Active Directory authentication with Tableau Server, the 4.1 release adds several new capabilities to help you configure domain information. You can now specify the domain nickname during installation and modify both full domain names and nicknames after the server is up and running.\tServer Performance Improvements\nMany customers using Tableau Server will see performance improvements with the Tableau 4.1 upgrade. Specifically pages may load faster when requesting a view. In addition, the server has improved data caching, which increases responsiveness during interactive sessions. Refresh the data cache at any time to reload from the underlying data source.\nSingle Logon for Multiple Sheets\nTableau Desktop now only asks you to logon to each database one time per workbook. The username and password provided are reused for each sheet that connects to the same server and database. For example, a workbook with three sheets, each connecting to different tables in the same database, will now only prompt you logon once instead of three times as in prior versions.\nConnect to More Databases\nTableau 4.1 now supports connections to both Teradata and Vertica databases. You need a special product key to connect to these databases. Contact your account manager to learn more.\nOther Changes\nTableau Desktop\nConnections to Cache databases would sometimes be closed when opening multiple workbooks at a time. \nCorrected some syntax problems with queries to MySQL that were using FULL JOIN rather than OUTER JOIN. MySQL does not support FULL JOIN. \nSheet links when using Microsoft Analysis Services from Tableau Server was constructing slow MDX queries. These queries have been optimized. \nCorrected an issue with querying time and timestamp data from Netezza databases. \nDatasets with Latitude or Longitude defined as discrete datatypes would cause the application to crash. This is now handled correctly. \nTableau would crash when saving in certain cases. Issue was related to creating certain thumbnail images, which has been corrected. \nMarks drawn for zip code 14208 were placed in the wrong location. \nCorrected issue where sheet links would work would work initially, but they would fail after saving and reopening the workbook. The problem was related to links on dates not retaining the proper date formatting for the link syntax when saved. \nCorrected problem when using Tableau online maps where not all map tiles would be retrieved. \nAdded support for double-clicking a TMS file to launch the application. \nCorrected problem with Tableau 4.0 and Oracle SmartView 9.3.1 being installed on the same machine. \nCorrected problems loading file fbclient.dll from Desktop clients. \nAdded the ability to edit Active Directory domain names and nicknames to the Administrative interface. \nTableau would crash after a long period of inactivity on computers running Cisco Security Agent. This issue has been corrected. \nCorrected problems with offline activation still trying to send registration information over the internet. \nCorrected problems retrieving updated maintenance renewal information. \nTableau Server\nCorrected issue of Tableau Server not being able to install on German operating systems. \nTableau Server was performing license checks too frequently, causing poor performance when opening views while this check was performed. Tableau Server now checks for a valid license only once per day. \nTableau Server would display the Select All option on quick filters that were set to single select mode . Choosing Select All would implicitly swap the quick filter to multi-select and then select all the values. This could cause very long running queries for large databases. Tableau Server now does not show the Select All button when in Single Select mode. \nCorrected problems when publishing very large workbooks to the Tableau Server . \nCorrected a crash in the VizQL Server process when canceling a query. \nSome workbooks with long running queries would fail when publishing to Tableau Server. A combination of code changes and server timeout settings correct this issue. \nTableau Server sheet links were not always url-encoding properly, which would result in a message saying the destination sheet did not exist. Sheet links are now correctly url-encoded. \nDocumentation improvements in the Online Help and Admin Guide relating to Active Directory trusted domains. \n","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"New Features","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"24/09/2008","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"New Features"},{"entry":"Web Map Service (WMS) Support","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"4.1","ReleaseDate":"24/09/2008","ApplicationName":"Tableau","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"datePattern":[""],"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"Web Map Service (WMS) Support"},{"entry":"Tableau 4.1 adds Web Map Service (WMS)support so you can retrieve custom maps from your own WMS servers.
