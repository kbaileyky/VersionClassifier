{"VersionNumber":"3.10.0","ReleaseDate":"10/09/2014","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.10.0 is a feature release with many improvements and the usual\ncollection of bug fixes.\nThis release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,\nPPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,\nMIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android, MIPS32/Android, X86/Android, X86/MacOSX 10.9\nand AMD64/MacOSX 10.9.  Support for MacOSX 10.8 and 10.9 is\nsignificantly improved relative to the 3.9.0 release.\n* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================\n* Support for the 64-bit ARM Architecture (AArch64 ARMv8).  This port\n  is mostly complete, and is usable, but some SIMD instructions are as\n  yet unsupported.\n* Support for little-endian variant of the 64-bit POWER architecture.\n* Support for Android on MIPS32.\n* Support for 64bit FPU on MIPS32 platforms.\n* Both 32- and 64-bit executables are supported on MacOSX 10.8 and 10.9.\n* Configuration for and running on Android targets has changed.\n  See README.android in the source tree for details.\n* ================== DEPRECATED FEATURES =================\n* --db-attach is now deprecated and will be removed in the next\n  valgrind feature release.  The built-in GDB server capabilities are\n  superior and should be used instead. Learn more here:\n  http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.gdbserver\n* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================\n* Memcheck:\n  - Client code can now selectively disable and re-enable reporting of\n    invalid address errors in specific ranges using the new client\n    requests VALGRIND_DISABLE_ADDR_ERROR_REPORTING_IN_RANGE and\n    VALGRIND_ENABLE_ADDR_ERROR_REPORTING_IN_RANGE.\n  - Leak checker: there is a new leak check heuristic called\n    \"length64\".  This is used to detect interior pointers pointing 8\n    bytes inside a block, on the assumption that the first 8 bytes\n    holds the value \"block size - 8\".  This is used by\n    sqlite3MemMalloc, for example.\n  - Checking of system call parameters: if a syscall parameter\n    (e.g. bind struct sockaddr, sendmsg struct msghdr, ...) has\n    several fields not initialised, an error is now reported for each\n    field. Previously, an error was reported only for the first\n    uninitialised field.\n  - Mismatched alloc/free checking: a new flag\n    --show-mismatched-frees=no|yes [yes] makes it possible to turn off\n    such checks if necessary.\n* Helgrind:\n  - Improvements to error messages:\n    o Race condition error message involving heap allocated blocks also\n      show the thread number that allocated the raced-on block.\n    o All locks referenced by an error message are now announced.\n      Previously, some error messages only showed the lock addresses.\n    o The message indicating where a lock was first observed now also\n      describes the address/location of the lock.\n  - Helgrind now understands the Ada task termination rules and\n    creates a happens-before relationship between a terminated task\n    and its master.  This avoids some false positives and avoids a big\n    memory leak when a lot of Ada tasks are created and terminated.\n    The interceptions are only activated with forthcoming releases of\n    gnatpro >= 7.3.0w-20140611 and gcc >= 5.0.\n  - A new GDB server monitor command \"info locks\" giving the list of\n    locks, their location, and their status.\n* Callgrind:\n  - callgrind_control now supports the --vgdb-prefix argument,\n    which is needed if valgrind was started with this same argument.\n* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================\n* Unwinding through inlined function calls.  Stack unwinding can now\n  make use of Dwarf3 inlined-unwind information if it is available.\n  The practical effect is that inlined calls become visible in stack\n  traces.  The suppression matching machinery has been adjusted\n  accordingly.  This is controlled by the new option\n  --read-inline-info=yes|no.  Currently this is enabled by default\n  only on Linux and Android targets and only for the tools Memcheck,\n  Helgrind and DRD.\n* Valgrind can now read EXIDX unwind information on 32-bit ARM\n  targets.  If an object contains both CFI and EXIDX unwind\n  information, Valgrind will prefer the CFI over the EXIDX.  This\n  facilitates unwinding through system libraries on arm-android\n  targets.\n* Address description logic has been improved and is now common\n  between Memcheck and Helgrind, resulting in better address\n  descriptions for some kinds of error messages.\n* Error messages about dubious arguments (eg, to malloc or calloc) are\n  output like other errors.  This means that they can be suppressed\n  and they have a stack trace.\n* The C++ demangler has been updated for better C++11 support.\n* New and modified GDB server monitor features:\n  - Thread local variables/storage (__thread) can now be displayed.\n  - The GDB server monitor command \"v.info location <address>\"\n    displays information about an address.  The information produced\n    depends on the tool and on the options given to valgrind.\n    Possibly, the following are described: global variables, local\n    (stack) variables, allocated or freed blocks, ...\n  - The option \"--vgdb-stop-at=event1,event2,...\" allows the user to\n    ask the GDB server to stop at the start of program execution, at\n    the end of the program execution and on Valgrind internal errors.\n  - A new monitor command \"v.info stats\" shows various Valgrind core\n    and tool statistics.\n  - A new monitor command \"v.set hostvisibility\" allows the GDB server\n    to provide access to Valgrind internal host status/memory.\n* A new option \"--aspace-minaddr=<address>\" can in some situations\n  allow the use of more memory by decreasing the address above which\n  Valgrind maps memory.  It can also be used to solve address\n  conflicts with system libraries by increasing the default value.\n  See user manual for details.\n* The amount of memory used by Valgrind to store debug info (unwind\n  info, line number information and symbol data) has been\n  significantly reduced, even though Valgrind now reads more\n  information in order to support unwinding of inlined function calls.\n* Dwarf3 handling with --read-var-info=yes has been improved:\n  - Ada and C struct containing VLAs no longer cause a \"bad DIE\" error\n  - Code compiled with\n    -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--gc-sections\n    no longer causes assertion failures.\n* Improved checking for the --sim-hints= and --kernel-variant=\n  options.  Unknown strings are now detected and reported to the user\n  as a usage error.\n* The semantics of stack start/end boundaries in the valgrind.h\n  VALGRIND_STACK_REGISTER client request has been clarified and\n  documented.  The convention is that start and end are respectively\n  the lowest and highest addressable bytes of the stack.\n* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================\nThe following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that \"n-i-bz\"\nstands for \"not in bugzilla\" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us\nbut never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in\nbugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather\nthan mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that\nare not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.\nTo see details of a given bug, visit\n  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXXX\nwhere XXXXXX is the bug number as listed below.\n175819  Support

{"VersionNumber":"3.9.0","ReleaseDate":"31/10/2013","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.9.0 is a feature release with many improvements and the usual\ncollection of bug fixes.\nThis release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,\nPPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux, MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android,\nX86/Android, X86/MacOSX 10.7 and AMD64/MacOSX 10.7.  Support for\nMacOSX 10.8 is significantly improved relative to the 3.8.0 release.\n* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================\n* Support for MIPS64 LE and BE running Linux.  Valgrind has been\n  tested on MIPS64 Debian Squeeze and Debian Wheezy distributions.\n* Support for MIPS DSP ASE on MIPS32 platforms.\n* Support for s390x Decimal Floating Point instructions on hosts that\n  have the DFP facility installed.\n* Support for POWER8 (Power ISA 2.07) instructions\n* Support for Intel AVX2 instructions.  This is available only on 64\n  bit code.\n* Initial support for Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions,\n  both RTM and HLE.\n* Initial support for Hardware Transactional Memory on POWER.\n* Improved support for MacOSX 10.8 (64-bit only).  Memcheck can now\n  run large GUI apps tolerably well.\n* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================\n* Memcheck:\n  - Improvements in handling of vectorised code, leading to\n    significantly fewer false error reports.  You need to use the flag\n    --partial-loads-ok=yes to get the benefits of these changes.\n  - Better control over the leak checker.  It is now possible to\n    specify which leak kinds (definite/indirect/possible/reachable)\n    should be displayed, which should be regarded as errors, and which\n    should be suppressed by a given leak suppression.  This is done\n    using the options --show-leak-kinds=kind1,kind2,..,\n    --errors-for-leak-kinds=kind1,kind2,.. and an optional\n    \"match-leak-kinds:\" line in suppression entries, respectively.\n    Note that generated leak suppressions contain this new line and\n    are therefore more specific than in previous releases.  To get the\n    same behaviour as previous releases, remove the \"match-leak-kinds:\"\n    line from generated suppressions before using them.\n  - Reduced \"possible leak\" reports from the leak checker by the use\n    of better heuristics.  The available heuristics provide detection\n    of valid interior pointers to std::stdstring, to new[] allocated\n    arrays with elements having destructors and to interior pointers\n    pointing to an inner part of a C++ object using multiple\n    inheritance.  They can be selected individually using the\n    option --leak-check-heuristics=heur1,heur2,...\n  - Better control of stacktrace acquisition for heap-allocated\n    blocks.  Using the --keep-stacktraces option, it is possible to\n    control independently whether a stack trace is acquired for each\n    allocation and deallocation.  This can be used to create better\n    \"use after free\" errors or to decrease Valgrind's resource\n    consumption by recording less information.\n  - Better reporting of leak suppression usage.  The list of used\n    suppressions (shown when the -v option is given) now shows, for\n    each leak suppressions, how many blocks and bytes it suppressed\n    during the last leak search.\n* Helgrind:\n  - False errors resulting from the use of statically initialised\n    mutexes and condition variables (PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALISER, etc)\n    have been removed.\n  - False errors resulting from the use of pthread_cond_waits that\n    timeout, have been removed.\n* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================\n* Some attempt to tune Valgrind's space requirements to the expected\n  capabilities of the target:\n  - The default size of the translation cache has been reduced from 8\n    sectors to 6 on Android platforms, since each sector occupies\n    about 40MB when using Memcheck.\n  - The default size of the translation cache has been increased to 16\n    sectors on all other platforms, reflecting the fact that large\n    applications require instrumentation and storage of huge amounts\n    of code.  For similar reasons, the number of memory mapped\n    segments that can be tracked has been increased by a factor of 6.\n  - In all cases, the maximum number of sectors in the translation\n    cache can be controlled by the new flag --num-transtab-sectors.\n* Changes in how debug info (line numbers, etc) is read:\n  - Valgrind no longer temporarily mmaps the entire object to read\n    from it.  Instead, reading is done through a small fixed sized\n    buffer.  This avoids virtual memory usage spikes when Valgrind\n    reads debuginfo from large shared objects.\n  - A new experimental remote debug info server.  Valgrind can read\n    debug info from a different machine (typically, a build host)\n    where debuginfo objects are stored.  This can save a lot of time\n    and hassle when running Valgrind on resource-constrained targets\n    (phones, tablets) when the full debuginfo objects are stored\n    somewhere else.  This is enabled by the --debuginfo-server=\n    option.\n  - Consistency checking between main and debug objects can be\n    disabled using the --allow-mismatched-debuginfo option.\n* Stack unwinding by stack scanning, on ARM.  Unwinding by stack\n  scanning can recover stack traces in some cases when the normal\n  unwind mechanisms fail.  Stack scanning is best described as \"a\n  nasty, dangerous and misleading hack\" and so is disabled by default.\n  Use --unw-stack-scan-thresh and --unw-stack-scan-frames to enable\n  and control it.\n* Detection and merging of recursive stack frame cycles.  When your\n  program has recursive algorithms, this limits the memory used by\n  Valgrind for recorded stack traces and avoids recording\n  uninteresting repeated calls.  This is controlled by the command\n  line option --merge-recursive-frame and by the monitor command\n  \"v.set merge-recursive-frames\".\n* File name and line numbers for used suppressions.  The list of used\n  suppressions (shown when the -v option is given) now shows, for each\n  used suppression, the file name and line number where the suppression\n  is defined.\n* New and modified GDB server monitor features:\n  - valgrind.h has a new client request, VALGRIND_MONITOR_COMMAND,\n    that can be used to execute gdbserver monitor commands from the\n    client program.\n  - A new monitor command, \"v.info open_fds\", that gives the list of\n    open file descriptors and additional details.\n  - An optional message in the \"v.info n_errs_found\" monitor command,\n    for example \"v.info n_errs_found test 1234 finished\", allowing a\n    comment string to be added to the process output, perhaps for the\n    purpose of separating errors of different tests or test phases.\n  - A new monitor command \"v.info execontext\" that shows information\n    about the stack traces recorded by Valgrind.\n  - A new monitor command \"v.do expensive_sanity_check_general\" to run\n    some internal consistency checks.\n* New flag --sigill-diagnostics to control whether a diagnostic\n  message is printed when the JIT encounters an instruction it can't\n  translate.  The actual behavior -- delivery of SIGILL to the\n  application -- is unchanged.\n* The maximum amount of memory that Valgrind can use on 64 bit targets\n  has been increased from 32GB to 64GB.  This should make it possible\n  to run applications on Memcheck that natively require up to about 35GB.\n* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================\nThe following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that \"n-i-bz\"\nstands for \"not in bugzilla\" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us\nbut never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in\nbugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather\nthan mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that\nare not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.\nTo see details of a given bug, visit\n  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXXX\nwhere XXXXXX is the bug number as listed below.\n123837  system

{"VersionNumber":"3.8.1","ReleaseDate":"19/09/2012","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.8.1 is a bug fix release.  It fixes some assertion failures in 3.8.0\nthat occur moderately frequently in real use cases, adds support for\nsome missing instructions on ARM, and fixes a deadlock condition on\nMacOSX.

{"VersionNumber":"3.8.0","ReleaseDate":"10/08/2012","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.8.0 is a feature release with many improvements and the usual\ncollection of bug fixes.\nThis release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,\nPPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS/Linux, ARM/Android, X86/Android,\nX86/MacOSX 10.6/10.7 and AMD64/MacOSX 10.6/10.7.  Support for recent\ndistros and toolchain components (glibc 2.16, gcc 4.7) has been added.\nThere is initial support for MacOSX 10.8, but it is not usable for\nserious work at present.\n* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================\n* Support for MIPS32 platforms running Linux.  Valgrind has been\n  tested on MIPS32 and MIPS32r2 platforms running different Debian\n  Squeeze and MeeGo distributions.  Both little-endian and big-endian\n  cores are supported.  The tools Memcheck, Massif and Lackey have\n  been tested and are known to work. See README.mips for more details.\n* Preliminary support for Android running on x86.\n* Preliminary (as-yet largely unusable) support for MacOSX 10.8.\n* Support for Intel AVX instructions and for AES instructions.  This\n  support is available only for 64 bit code.\n* Support for POWER Decimal Floating Point instructions.\n* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================\n* Non-libc malloc implementations are now supported.  This is useful\n  for tools that replace malloc (Memcheck, Massif, DRD, Helgrind).\n  Using the new option --soname-synonyms, such tools can be informed\n  that the malloc implementation is either linked statically into the\n  executable, or is present in some other shared library different\n  from libc.so.  This makes it possible to process statically linked\n  programs, and programs using other malloc libraries, for example\n  TCMalloc or JEMalloc.\n* For tools that provide their own replacement for malloc et al, the\n  option --redzone-size=<number> allows users to specify the size of\n  the padding blocks (redzones) added before and after each client\n  allocated block.  Smaller redzones decrease the memory needed by\n  Valgrind.  Bigger redzones increase the chance to detect blocks\n  overrun or underrun.  Prior to this change, the redzone size was\n  hardwired to 16 bytes in Memcheck.\n* Memcheck:\n  - The leak_check GDB server monitor command now can\n    control the maximum nr of loss records to output.\n  - Reduction of memory use for applications allocating\n    many blocks and/or having many partially defined bytes.\n  - Addition of GDB server monitor command 'block_list' that lists\n    the addresses/sizes of the blocks of a leak search loss record.\n  - Addition of GDB server monitor command 'who_points_at' that lists\n    the locations pointing at a block.\n  - If a redzone size > 0 is given, VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK now will\n    detect an invalid access of these redzones, by marking them\n    noaccess.  Similarly, if a redzone size is given for a memory\n    pool, VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_ALLOC will mark the redzones no access.\n    This still allows to find some bugs if the user has forgotten to\n    mark the pool superblock noaccess.\n  - Performance of memory leak check has been improved, especially in\n    cases where there are many leaked blocks and/or many suppression\n    rules used to suppress leak reports.\n  - Reduced noise (false positive) level on MacOSX 10.6/10.7, due to\n    more precise analysis, which is important for LLVM/Clang\n    generated code.  This is at the cost of somewhat reduced\n    performance.  Note there is no change to analysis precision or\n    costs on Linux targets.\n* DRD:\n  - Added even more facilities that can help finding the cause of a data\n    race, namely the command-line option --ptrace-addr and the macro\n    DRD_STOP_TRACING_VAR(x). More information can be found in the manual.\n  - Fixed a subtle bug that could cause false positive data race reports.\n* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================\n* The C++ demangler has been updated so as to work well with C++ \n  compiled by up to at least g++ 4.6.\n* Tool developers can make replacement/wrapping more flexible thanks\n  to the new option --soname-synonyms.  This was reported above, but\n  in fact is very general and applies to all function\n  replacement/wrapping, not just to malloc-family functions.\n* Round-robin scheduling of threads can be selected, using the new\n  option --fair-sched= yes.  Prior to this change, the pipe-based\n  thread serialisation mechanism (which is still the default) could\n  give very unfair scheduling.  --fair-sched=yes improves\n  responsiveness of interactive multithreaded applications, and\n  improves repeatability of results from the thread checkers Helgrind\n  and DRD.\n* For tool developers: support to run Valgrind on Valgrind has been\n  improved.  We can now routinely Valgrind on Helgrind or Memcheck.\n* gdbserver now shows the float shadow registers as integer\n  rather than float values, as the shadow values are mostly\n  used as bit patterns.\n* Increased limit for the --num-callers command line flag to 500.\n* Performance improvements for error matching when there are many\n  suppression records in use.\n* Improved support for DWARF4 debugging information (bug 284184).\n* Initial support for DWZ compressed Dwarf debug info.\n* Improved control over the IR optimiser's handling of the tradeoff\n  between performance and precision of exceptions.  Specifically,\n  --vex-iropt-precise-memory-exns has been removed and replaced by\n  --vex-iropt-register-updates, with extended functionality.  This\n  allows the Valgrind gdbserver to always show up to date register\n  values to GDB.\n* Modest performance gains through the use of translation chaining for\n  JIT-generated code.\n* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================\nThe following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that \"n-i-bz\"\nstands for \"not in bugzilla\" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us\nbut never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in\nbugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather\nthan mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that\nare not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.\nTo see details of a given bug, visit\n  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXXX\nwhere XXXXXX is the bug number as listed below.\n197914  Building

{"VersionNumber":"3.7.0","ReleaseDate":"05/11/2011","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.7.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the\nusual collection of bug fixes.\nThis release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,\nPPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, ARM/Android, X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin.\nSupport for recent distros and toolchain components (glibc 2.14, gcc\n4.6, MacOSX 10.7) has been added.\n* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================\n* Support for IBM z/Architecture (s390x) running Linux.  Valgrind can\n  analyse 64-bit programs running on z/Architecture.  Most user space\n  instructions up to and including z10 are supported.  Valgrind has\n  been tested extensively on z9, z10, and z196 machines running SLES\n  10/11, RedHat 5/6m, and Fedora. The Memcheck and Massif tools are\n  known to work well. Callgrind, Helgrind, and DRD work reasonably\n  well on z9 and later models. See README.s390 for more details.\n* Preliminary support for MacOSX 10.7 and XCode 4.  Both 32- and\n  64-bit processes are supported.  Some complex threaded applications\n  (Firefox) are observed to hang when run as 32 bit applications,\n  whereas 64-bit versions run OK.  The cause is unknown.  Memcheck\n  will likely report some false errors.  In general, expect some rough\n  spots.  This release also supports MacOSX 10.6, but drops support\n  for 10.5.\n* Preliminary support for Android (on ARM).  Valgrind can now run\n  large applications (eg, Firefox) on (eg) a Samsung Nexus S.  See\n  README.android for more details, plus instructions on how to get\n  started.\n* Support for the IBM Power ISA 2.06 (Power7 instructions)\n* General correctness and performance improvements for ARM/Linux, and,\n  by extension, ARM/Android.\n* Further solidification of support for SSE 4.2 in 64-bit mode.  AVX\n  instruction set support is under development but is not available in\n  this release.\n* Support for AIX5 has been removed.\n* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================\n* Memcheck: some incremental changes:\n  - reduction of memory use in some circumstances\n  - improved handling of freed memory, which in some circumstances \n    can cause detection of use-after-free that would previously have\n    been missed\n  - fix of a longstanding bug that could cause false negatives (missed\n    errors) in programs doing vector saturated narrowing instructions.\n* Helgrind: performance improvements and major memory use reductions,\n  particularly for large, long running applications which perform many\n  synchronisation (lock, unlock, etc) events.  Plus many smaller\n  changes:\n  - display of locksets for both threads involved in a race\n  - general improvements in formatting/clarity of error messages\n  - addition of facilities and documentation regarding annotation\n    of thread safe reference counted C++ classes\n  - new flag --check-stack-refs=no|yes [yes], to disable race checking\n    on thread stacks (a performance hack)\n  - new flag --free-is-write=no|yes [no], to enable detection of races\n    where one thread accesses heap memory but another one frees it,\n    without any coordinating synchronisation event\n* DRD: enabled XML output; added support for delayed thread deletion\n  in order to detect races that occur close to the end of a thread\n  (--join-list-vol); fixed a memory leak triggered by repeated client\n  memory allocatation and deallocation; improved Darwin support.\n* exp-ptrcheck: this tool has been renamed to exp-sgcheck\n* exp-sgcheck: this tool has been reduced in scope so as to improve\n  performance and remove checking that Memcheck does better.\n  Specifically, the ability to check for overruns for stack and global\n  arrays is unchanged, but the ability to check for overruns of heap\n  blocks has been removed.  The tool has accordingly been renamed to\n  exp-sgcheck (\"Stack and Global Array Checking\").\n* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================\n* GDB server: Valgrind now has an embedded GDB server.  That means it\n  is possible to control a Valgrind run from GDB, doing all the usual\n  things that GDB can do (single stepping, breakpoints, examining\n  data, etc).  Tool-specific functionality is also available.  For\n  example, it is possible to query the definedness state of variables\n  or memory from within GDB when running Memcheck; arbitrarily large\n  memory watchpoints are supported, etc.  To use the GDB server, start\n  Valgrind with the flag --vgdb-error=0 and follow the on-screen\n  instructions.\n* Improved support for unfriendly self-modifying code: a new option\n  --smc-check=all-non-file is available.  This adds the relevant\n  consistency checks only to code that originates in non-file-backed\n  mappings.  In effect this confines the consistency checking only to\n  code that is or might be JIT generated, and avoids checks on code\n  that must have been compiled ahead of time.  This significantly\n  improves performance on applications that generate code at run time.\n* It is now possible to build a working Valgrind using Clang-2.9 on\n  Linux.\n* new client requests VALGRIND_{DISABLE,ENABLE}_ERROR_REPORTING.\n  These enable and disable error reporting on a per-thread, and\n  nestable, basis.  This is useful for hiding errors in particularly\n  troublesome pieces of code.  The MPI wrapper library (libmpiwrap.c)\n  now uses this facility.\n* Added the --mod-funcname option to cg_diff.\n* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================\nThe following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that \"n-i-bz\"\nstands for \"not in bugzilla\" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us\nbut never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in\nbugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than\nmailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are\nnot entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.\nTo see details of a given bug, visit\nhttps://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXXX\nwhere XXXXXX is the bug number as listed below.\n 79311  malloc silly arg warning

{"VersionNumber":"3.6.0","ReleaseDate":"21/10/2010","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.6.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the\nusual collection of bug fixes.\nThis release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,\nPPC64/Linux, X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin.  Support for recent distros\nand toolchain components (glibc 2.12, gcc 4.5, OSX 10.6) has been added.\n                    -------------------------\nHere are some highlights.  Details are shown further down:\n* Support for ARM/Linux.\n* Support for recent Linux distros: Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 14.\n* Support for Mac OS X 10.6, both 32- and 64-bit executables.\n* Support for the SSE4.2 instruction set.\n* Enhancements to the Callgrind profiler, including the ability to\n  handle CPUs with three levels of cache.\n* A new experimental heap profiler, DHAT.\n* A huge number of bug fixes and small enhancements.\n                    -------------------------\nHere are details of the above changes, together with descriptions of\nmany other changes, and a list of fixed bugs.\n* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================\n* Support for ARM/Linux.  Valgrind now runs on ARMv7 capable CPUs\n  running Linux.  It is known to work on Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 10.10,\n  and Maemo 5, so you can run Valgrind on your Nokia N900 if you want.\n  This requires a CPU capable of running the ARMv7-A instruction set\n  (Cortex A5, A8 and A9).  Valgrind provides fairly complete coverage\n  of the user space instruction set, including ARM and Thumb integer\n  code, VFPv3, NEON and V6 media instructions.  The Memcheck,\n  Cachegrind and Massif tools work properly; other tools work to\n  varying degrees.\n* Support for recent Linux distros (Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 14), along\n  with support for recent releases of the underlying toolchain\n  components, notably gcc-4.5 and glibc-2.12.\n* Support for Mac OS X 10.6, both 32- and 64-bit executables.  64-bit\n  support also works much better on OS X 10.5, and is as solid as\n  32-bit support now.\n* Support for the SSE4.2 instruction set.  SSE4.2 is supported in\n  64-bit mode.  In 32-bit mode, support is only available up to and\n  including SSSE3.  Some exceptions: SSE4.2 AES instructions are not\n  supported in 64-bit mode, and 32-bit mode does in fact support the\n  bare minimum SSE4 instructions to needed to run programs on Mac OS X\n  10.6 on 32-bit targets.\n* Support for IBM POWER6 cpus has been improved.  The Power ISA up to\n  and including version 2.05 is supported.\n* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================\n* Cachegrind has a new processing script, cg_diff, which finds the\n  difference between two profiles.  It's very useful for evaluating\n  the performance effects of a change in a program.\n  Related to this change, the meaning of cg_annotate's (rarely-used)\n  --threshold option has changed; this is unlikely to affect many\n  people, if you do use it please see the user manual for details.\n* Callgrind now can do branch prediction simulation, similar to\n  Cachegrind.  In addition, it optionally can count the number of\n  executed global bus events.  Both can be used for a better\n  approximation of a \"Cycle Estimation\" as derived event (you need to\n  update the event formula in KCachegrind yourself).\n* Cachegrind and Callgrind now refer to the LL (last-level) cache\n  rather than the L2 cache.  This is to accommodate machines with\n  three levels of caches -- if Cachegrind/Callgrind auto-detects the\n  cache configuration of such a machine it will run the simulation as\n  if the L2 cache isn't present.  This means the results are less\n  likely to match the true result for the machine, but\n  Cachegrind/Callgrind's results are already only approximate, and\n  should not be considered authoritative.  The results are still\n  useful for giving a general idea about a program's locality.\n* Massif has a new option, --pages-as-heap, which is disabled by\n  default.  When enabled, instead of tracking allocations at the level\n  of heap blocks (as allocated with malloc/new/new[]), it instead\n  tracks memory allocations at the level of memory pages (as mapped by\n  mmap, brk, etc).  Each mapped page is treated as its own block.\n  Interpreting the page-level output is harder than the heap-level\n  output, but this option is useful if you want to account for every\n  byte of memory used by a program.\n* DRD has two new command-line options: --free-is-write and\n  --trace-alloc.  The former allows to detect reading from already freed\n  memory, and the latter allows tracing of all memory allocations and\n  deallocations.\n* DRD has several new annotations.  Custom barrier implementations can\n  now be annotated, as well as benign races on static variables.\n* DRD's happens before / happens after annotations have been made more\n  powerful, so that they can now also be used to annotate e.g. a smart\n  pointer implementation.\n* Helgrind's annotation set has also been drastically improved, so as\n  to provide to users a general set of annotations to describe locks,\n  semaphores, barriers and condition variables.  Annotations to\n  describe thread-safe reference counted heap objects have also been\n  added.\n* Memcheck has a new command-line option, --show-possibly-lost, which\n  is enabled by default.  When disabled, the leak detector will not\n  show possibly-lost blocks.\n* A new experimental heap profiler, DHAT (Dynamic Heap Analysis Tool),\n  has been added.  DHAT keeps track of allocated heap blocks, and also\n  inspects every memory reference to see which block (if any) is being\n  accessed.  This gives a lot of insight into block lifetimes,\n  utilisation, turnover, liveness, and the location of hot and cold\n  fields.  You can use DHAT to do hot-field profiling.\n* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================\n* Improved support for unfriendly self-modifying code: the extra\n  overhead incurred by --smc-check=all has been reduced by\n  approximately a factor of 5 as compared with 3.5.0.\n* Ability to show directory names for source files in error messages.\n  This is combined with a flexible mechanism for specifying which\n  parts of the paths should be shown.  This is enabled by the new flag\n  --fullpath-after.\n* A new flag, --require-text-symbol, which will stop the run if a\n  specified symbol is not found it a given shared object when it is\n  loaded into the process.  This makes advanced working with function\n  intercepting and wrapping safer and more reliable.\n* Improved support for the Valkyrie GUI, version 2.0.0.  GUI output\n  and control of Valgrind is now available for the tools Memcheck and\n  Helgrind.  XML output from Valgrind is available for Memcheck,\n  Helgrind and exp-Ptrcheck.\n* More reliable stack unwinding on amd64-linux, particularly in the\n  presence of function wrappers, and with gcc-4.5 compiled code.\n* Modest scalability (performance improvements) for massive\n  long-running applications, particularly for those with huge amounts\n  of code.\n* Support for analyzing programs running under Wine with has been\n  improved.  The header files <valgrind/valgrind.h>,\n  <valgrind/memcheck.h> and <valgrind/drd.h> can now be used in\n  Windows-programs compiled with MinGW or one of the Microsoft Visual\n  Studio compilers.\n* A rare but serious error in the 64-bit x86 CPU simulation was fixed.\n  The 32-bit simulator was not affected.  This did not occur often,\n  but when it did would usually crash the program under test.\n  Bug 245925.\n* A large number of bugs were fixed.  These are shown below.\n* A number of bugs were investigated, and were candidates for fixing,\n  but are not fixed in 3.6.0, due to lack of developer time.  They may\n  get fixed in later releases.

{"VersionNumber":"3.5.0","ReleaseDate":"19/08/2009","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.5.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the\nusual collection of bug fixes.  The main improvement is that Valgrind\nnow works on Mac OS X.\nThis release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64/Linux\nand X86/Darwin.  Support for recent distros and toolchain components\n(glibc 2.10, gcc 4.5) has been added.\n                    -------------------------\nHere is a short summary of the changes.  Details are shown further\ndown:\n* Support for Mac OS X (10.5.x).\n* Improvements and simplifications to Memcheck's leak checker.\n* Clarification and simplifications in various aspects of Valgrind's\n  text output.\n* XML output for Helgrind and Ptrcheck.\n* Performance and stability improvements for Helgrind and DRD.\n* Genuinely atomic support for x86/amd64/ppc atomic instructions.\n* A new experimental tool, BBV, useful for computer architecture\n  research.\n* Improved Wine support, including ability to read Windows PDB\n  debuginfo.\n                    -------------------------\nHere are details of the above changes, followed by descriptions of\nmany other minor changes, and a list of fixed bugs.\n* Valgrind now runs on Mac OS X.  (Note that Mac OS X is sometimes\n  called \"Darwin\" because that is the name of the OS core, which is the\n  level that Valgrind works at.)\n  Supported systems:\n  - It requires OS 10.5.x (Leopard).  Porting to 10.4.x is not planned\n    because it would require work and 10.4 is only becoming less common.\n  - 32-bit programs on x86 and AMD64 (a.k.a x86-64) machines are supported\n    fairly well.  For 10.5.x, 32-bit programs are the default even on\n    64-bit machines, so it handles most current programs.\n  - 64-bit programs on x86 and AMD64 (a.k.a x86-64) machines are not\n    officially supported, but simple programs at least will probably work.\n    However, start-up is slow.\n  - PowerPC machines are not supported.\n  Things that don't work:\n  - The Ptrcheck tool.\n  - Objective-C garbage collection.\n  - --db-attach=yes.\n  - If you have Rogue Amoeba's \"Instant Hijack\" program installed,\n    Valgrind will fail with a SIGTRAP at start-up.  See\n    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193917 for details and a\n    simple work-around.\n  Usage notes:\n  - You will likely find --dsymutil=yes a useful option, as error\n    messages may be imprecise without it.\n  - Mac OS X support is new and therefore will be less robust than the\n    Linux support.  Please report any bugs you find.\n  - Threaded programs may run more slowly than on Linux.\n  Many thanks to Greg Parker for developing this port over several years.\n* Memcheck's leak checker has been improved.  \n  - The results for --leak-check=summary now match the summary results\n    for --leak-check=full.  Previously they could differ because\n    --leak-check=summary counted \"indirectly lost\" blocks and\n    \"suppressed\" blocks as \"definitely lost\".\n  - Blocks that are only reachable via at least one interior-pointer,\n    but are directly pointed to by a start-pointer, were previously\n    marked as \"still reachable\".  They are now correctly marked as\n    \"possibly lost\".\n  - The default value for the --leak-resolution option has been\n    changed from \"low\" to \"high\".  In general, this means that more\n    leak reports will be produced, but each leak report will describe\n    fewer leaked blocks.\n  - With --leak-check=full, \"definitely lost\" and \"possibly lost\"\n    leaks are now considered as proper errors, ie. they are counted\n    for the \"ERROR SUMMARY\" and affect the behaviour of\n    --error-exitcode.  These leaks are not counted as errors if\n    --leak-check=summary is specified, however.\n  - Documentation for the leak checker has been improved.\n* Various aspects of Valgrind's text output have changed.\n  - Valgrind's start-up message has changed.  It is shorter but also\n    includes the command being run, which makes it easier to use\n    --trace-children=yes.  An example:\n  - Valgrind's shut-down messages have also changed.  This is most\n    noticeable with Memcheck, where the leak summary now occurs before\n    the error summary.  This change was necessary to allow leaks to be\n    counted as proper errors (see the description of the leak checker\n    changes above for more details).  This was also necessary to fix a\n    longstanding bug in which uses of suppressions against leaks were\n    not \"counted\", leading to difficulties in maintaining suppression\n    files (see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186790).\n  - Behavior of -v has changed.  In previous versions, -v printed out\n    a mixture of marginally-user-useful information, and tool/core\n    statistics.  The statistics printing has now been moved to its own\n    flag, --stats=yes.  This means -v is less verbose and more likely\n    to convey useful end-user information.\n  - The format of some (non-XML) stack trace entries has changed a\n    little.  Previously there were six possible forms:\n      0x80483BF: really (a.c:20)\n      0x80483BF: really (in /foo/a.out)\n      0x80483BF: really\n      0x80483BF: (within /foo/a.out)\n      0x80483BF: ??? (a.c:20)\n      0x80483BF: ???\n    The third and fourth of these forms have been made more consistent\n    with the others.  The six possible forms are now:\n      0x80483BF: really (a.c:20)\n      0x80483BF: really (in /foo/a.out)\n      0x80483BF: really (in ???)\n      0x80483BF: ??? (in /foo/a.out)\n      0x80483BF: ??? (a.c:20)\n      0x80483BF: ???\n    Stack traces produced when --xml=yes is specified are different\n    and unchanged.\n* Helgrind and Ptrcheck now support XML output, so they can be used\n  from GUI tools.  Also, the XML output mechanism has been\n  overhauled.\n  - The XML format has been overhauled and generalised, so it is more\n    suitable for error reporting tools in general.  The Memcheck\n    specific aspects of it have been removed.  The new format, which\n    is an evolution of the old format, is described in\n    docs/internals/xml-output-protocol4.txt.\n  - Memcheck has been updated to use the new format.\n  - Helgrind and Ptrcheck are now able to emit output in this format.\n  - The XML output mechanism has been overhauled.  XML is now output\n    to its own file descriptor, which means that:\n    * Valgrind can output text and XML independently.\n    * The longstanding problem of XML output being corrupted by \n      unexpected un-tagged text messages  is solved.\n    As before, the destination for text output is specified using\n    --log-file=, --log-fd= or --log-socket=.\n    As before, XML output for a tool is enabled using --xml=yes.\n    Because there's a new XML output channel, the XML output\n    destination is now specified by --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or\n    --xml-socket=.\n    Initial feedback has shown this causes some confusion.  To\n    clarify, the two envisaged usage scenarios are:\n    (1) Normal text output.  In this case, do not specify --xml=yes\n        nor any of --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or --xml-socket=.\n    (2) XML output.  In this case, specify --xml=yes, and one of\n        --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or --xml-socket= to select the XML\n        destination, one of --log-file=, --log-fd= or --log-socket=\n        to select the destination for any remaining text messages,\n        and, importantly, -q.\n        -q makes Valgrind completely silent on the text channel,\n        except in the case of critical failures, such as Valgrind\n        itself segfaulting, or failing to read debugging information.\n        Hence, in this scenario, it suffices to check whether or not\n        any output appeared on the text channel.  If yes, then it is\n        likely to be a critical error which should be brought to the\n        attention of the user.  If no (the text channel produced no\n        output) then it can be assumed that the run was successful.\n        This allows GUIs to make the critical distinction they need to\n        make (did the run fail or not?) without having to search or\n        filter the text output channel in any way.\n    It is also recommended to use --child-silent-after-fork=yes in\n    scenario (2).\n* Improvements and changes in Helgrind:\n  - XML output, as described above\n  - Checks for consistent association between pthread condition\n    variables and their associated mutexes are now performed.\n  - pthread_spinlock functions are supported.\n  - Modest performance improvements.\n  - Initial (skeletal) support for describing the behaviour of\n    non-POSIX synchronisation objects through ThreadSanitizer\n    compatible ANNOTATE_* macros.\n  - More controllable tradeoffs between performance and the level of\n    detail of \"previous\" accesses in a race.  There are now three\n    settings:\n    * --history-level=full.  This is the default, and was also the\n      default in 3.4.x.  It shows both stacks involved in a race, but\n      requires a lot of memory and can be very slow in programs that\n      do many inter-thread synchronisation events.\n    * --history-level=none.  This only shows the later stack involved\n      in a race.  This can be much faster than --history-level=full,\n      but makes it much more difficult to find the other access\n      involved in the race.\n    The new intermediate setting is\n    * --history-level=approx\n      For the earlier (other) access, two stacks are presented.  The\n      earlier access is guaranteed to be somewhere in between the two\n      program points denoted by those stacks.  This is not as useful\n      as showing the exact stack for the previous access (as per\n      --history-level=full), but it is better than nothing, and it's\n      almost as fast as --history-level=none.\n* New features and improvements in DRD:\n  - The error messages printed by DRD are now easier to interpret.\n    Instead of using two different numbers to identify each thread\n    (Valgrind thread ID and DRD thread ID), DRD does now identify\n    threads via a single number (the DRD thread ID).  Furthermore\n    \"first observed at\" information is now printed for all error\n    messages related to synchronization objects.\n  - Added support for named semaphores (sem_open() and sem_close()).\n  - Race conditions between pthread_barrier_wait() and\n    pthread_barrier_destroy() calls are now reported.\n  - Added support for custom allocators through the macros\n    VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK() VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK() (defined in\n    in <valgrind/valgrind.h>). An alternative for these two macros is\n    the new client request VG_USERREQ__DRD_CLEAN_MEMORY (defined in\n    <valgrind/drd.h>).\n  - Added support for annotating non-POSIX synchronization objects\n    through several new ANNOTATE_*() macros.\n  - OpenMP: added support for the OpenMP runtime (libgomp) included\n    with gcc versions 4.3.0 and 4.4.0.\n  - Faster operation.\n  - Added two new command-line options (--first-race-only and\n    --segment-merging-interval).\n* Genuinely atomic support for x86/amd64/ppc atomic instructions\n  Valgrind will now preserve (memory-access) atomicity of LOCK-\n  prefixed x86/amd64 instructions, and any others implying a global\n  bus lock.  Ditto for PowerPC l{w,d}arx/st{w,d}cx. instructions.\n  This means that Valgrinded processes will \"play nicely\" in\n  situations where communication with other processes, or the kernel,\n  is done through shared memory and coordinated with such atomic\n  instructions.  Prior to this change, such arrangements usually\n  resulted in hangs, races or other synchronisation failures, because\n  Valgrind did not honour atomicity of such instructions.\n* A new experimental tool, BBV, has been added.  BBV generates basic\n  block vectors for use with the SimPoint analysis tool, which allows\n  a program's overall behaviour to be approximated by running only a\n  fraction of it.  This is useful for computer architecture\n  researchers.  You can run BBV by specifying --tool=exp-bbv (the\n  \"exp-\" prefix is short for \"experimental\").  BBV was written by\n  Vince Weaver.\n* Modestly improved support for running Windows applications under\n  Wine.  In particular, initial support for reading Windows .PDB debug\n  information has been added.\n* A new Memcheck client request VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAK_BLOCKS has been\n  added.  It is similar to VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAKS but counts blocks\n  instead of bytes.\n* The Valgrind client requests VALGRIND_PRINTF and\n  VALGRIND_PRINTF_BACKTRACE have been changed slightly.  Previously,\n  the string was always printed immediately on its own line.  Now, the\n  string will be added to a buffer but not printed until a newline is\n  encountered, or other Valgrind output is printed (note that for\n  VALGRIND_PRINTF_BACKTRACE, the back-trace itself is considered\n  \"other Valgrind output\").  This allows you to use multiple\n  VALGRIND_PRINTF calls to build up a single output line, and also to\n  print multiple output lines with a single request (by embedding\n  multiple newlines in the string).\n* The graphs drawn by Massif's ms_print program have changed slightly:\n  - The half-height chars '.' and ',' are no longer drawn, because\n    they are confusing.  The --y option can be used if the default\n    y-resolution is not high enough.\n  - Horizontal lines are now drawn after the top of a snapshot if\n    there is a gap until the next snapshot.  This makes it clear that\n    the memory usage has not dropped to zero between snapshots.\n* Something that happened in 3.4.0, but wasn't clearly announced: the\n  option --read-var-info=yes can be used by some tools (Memcheck,\n  Helgrind and DRD).  When enabled, it causes Valgrind to read DWARF3\n  variable type and location information.  This makes those tools\n  start up more slowly and increases memory consumption, but\n  descriptions of data addresses in error messages become more\n  detailed.\n* exp-Omega, an experimental instantaneous leak-detecting tool, was\n  disabled in 3.4.0 due to a lack of interest and maintenance,\n  although the source code was still in the distribution.  The source\n  code has now been removed from the distribution.  For anyone\n  interested, the removal occurred in SVN revision r10247.\n* Some changes have been made to the build system.\n  - VEX/ is now integrated properly into the build system.  This means\n    that dependency tracking within VEX/ now works properly, \"make\n    install\" will work without requiring \"make\" before it, and\n    parallel builds (ie. 'make -j') now work (previously a\n    .NOTPARALLEL directive was used to serialize builds, ie. 'make -j'\n    was effectively ignored).\n  - The --with-vex configure option has been removed.  It was of\n    little use and removing it simplified the build system.\n  - The location of some install files has changed.  This should not\n    affect most users.  Those who might be affected:\n    * For people who use Valgrind with MPI programs, the installed\n      libmpiwrap.so library has moved from\n      $(INSTALL)/<platform>/libmpiwrap.so to\n      $(INSTALL)/libmpiwrap-<platform>.so.\n    * For people who distribute standalone Valgrind tools, the\n      installed libraries such as $(INSTALL)/<platform>/libcoregrind.a\n      have moved to $(INSTALL)/libcoregrind-<platform>.a.\n    These changes simplify the build system.\n  - Previously, all the distributed suppression (*.supp) files were\n    installed.  Now, only default.supp is installed.  This should not\n    affect users as the other installed suppression files were not\n    read; the fact that they were installed was a mistake.\n* KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n  - Memcheck is unusable with the Intel compiler suite version 11.1,\n    when it generates code for SSE2-and-above capable targets.  This\n    is because of icc's use of highly optimised inlined strlen\n    implementations.  It causes Memcheck to report huge numbers of\n    false errors even in simple programs.  Helgrind and DRD may also\n    have problems.\n    Versions 11.0 and earlier may be OK, but this has not been\n    properly tested.\nThe following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that \"n-i-bz\"\nstands for \"not in bugzilla\" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us\nbut never got a bugzilla entry.

{"VersionNumber":"3.4.0","ReleaseDate":"02/01/2009","ReleaseContents":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n3.4.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the\nusual collection of bug fixes.  This release supports X86/Linux,\nAMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux and PPC64/Linux.  Support for recent distros\n(using gcc 4.4, glibc 2.8 and 2.9) has been added.\n3.4.0 brings some significant tool improvements.  Memcheck can now\nreport the origin of uninitialised values, the thread checkers\nHelgrind and DRD are much improved, and we have a new experimental\ntool, exp-Ptrcheck, which is able to detect overruns of stack and\nglobal arrays.  In detail:\n* Memcheck is now able to track the origin of uninitialised values.\n  When it reports an uninitialised value error, it will try to show\n  the origin of the value, as either a heap or stack allocation.\n  Origin tracking is expensive and so is not enabled by default.  To\n  use it, specify --track-origins=yes.  Memcheck's speed will be\n  essentially halved, and memory usage will be significantly\n  increased.  Nevertheless it can drastically reduce the effort\n  required to identify the root cause of uninitialised value errors,\n  and so is often a programmer productivity win, despite running more\n  slowly.\n* A version (1.4.0) of the Valkyrie GUI, that works with Memcheck in\n  3.4.0, will be released shortly.\n* Helgrind's race detection algorithm has been completely redesigned\n  and reimplemented, to address usability and scalability concerns:\n  - The new algorithm has a lower false-error rate: it is much less\n    likely to report races that do not really exist.\n  - Helgrind will display full call stacks for both accesses involved\n    in a race.  This makes it easier to identify the root causes of\n    races.\n  - Limitations on the size of program that can run have been removed.\n  - Performance has been modestly improved, although that is very\n    workload-dependent.\n  - Direct support for Qt4 threading has been added.\n  - pthread_barriers are now directly supported.\n  - Helgrind works well on all supported Linux targets.\n* The DRD thread debugging tool has seen major improvements:\n  - Greatly improved performance and significantly reduced memory\n    usage.\n  - Support for several major threading libraries (Boost.Thread, Qt4,\n    glib, OpenMP) has been added.\n  - Support for atomic instructions, POSIX semaphores, barriers and\n    reader-writer locks has been added.\n  - Works now on PowerPC CPUs too.\n  - Added support for printing thread stack usage at thread exit time.\n  - Added support for debugging lock contention.\n  - Added a manual for Drd.\n* A new experimental tool, exp-Ptrcheck, has been added.  Ptrcheck\n  checks for misuses of pointers.  In that sense it is a bit like\n  Memcheck.  However, Ptrcheck can do things Memcheck can't: it can\n  detect overruns of stack and global arrays, it can detect\n  arbitrarily far out-of-bounds accesses to heap blocks, and it can\n  detect accesses heap blocks that have been freed a very long time\n  ago (millions of blocks in the past).\n  Ptrcheck currently works only on x86-linux and amd64-linux.  To use\n  it, use --tool=exp-ptrcheck.  A simple manual is provided, as part\n  of the main Valgrind documentation.  As this is an experimental\n  tool, we would be particularly interested in hearing about your\n  experiences with it.\n* exp-Omega, an experimental instantaneous leak-detecting tool, is no\n  longer built by default, although the code remains in the repository\n  and the tarball.  This is due to three factors: a perceived lack of\n  users, a lack of maintenance, and concerns that it may not be\n  possible to achieve reliable operation using the existing design.\n* As usual, support for the latest Linux distros and toolchain\n  components has been added.  It should work well on Fedora Core 10,\n  OpenSUSE 11.1 and Ubuntu 8.10.  gcc-4.4 (in its current pre-release\n  state) is supported, as is glibc-2.9.  The C++ demangler has been\n  updated so as to work well with C++ compiled by even the most recent\n  g++'s.\n* You can now use frame-level wildcards in suppressions.  This was a\n  frequently-requested enhancement.  A line \"...\" in a suppression now\n  matches zero or more frames.  This makes it easier to write\n  suppressions which are precise yet insensitive to changes in\n  inlining behaviour.\n* 3.4.0 adds support on x86/amd64 for the SSSE3 instruction set.\n* Very basic support for IBM Power6 has been added (64-bit processes only).\n* Valgrind is now cross-compilable.  For example, it is possible to\n  cross compile Valgrind on an x86/amd64-linux host, so that it runs\n  on a ppc32/64-linux target.\n* You can set the main thread's stack size at startup using the\n  new --main-stacksize= flag (subject of course to ulimit settings).\n  This is useful for running apps that need a lot of stack space.\n* The limitation that you can't use --trace-children=yes together\n  with --db-attach=yes has been removed.\n* The following bugs have been fixed.  Note that \"n-i-bz\" stands for\n  \"not in bugzilla\" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but\n  never got a bugzilla entry.

This makes it possible to use the\n  framework to build tools that rely on knowing the type and locations\n  of stack and global variables, for example exp-Ptrcheck.\n  Reading of such information is disabled by default, because most\n  tools don't need it, and because it is expensive in space and time.\n  However, you can force Valgrind to read it, using the\n  --read-var-info=yes flag.  Memcheck, Helgrind and DRD are able to\n  make use of such information, if present, to provide source-level\n  descriptions of data addresses in the error messages they create.\n(3.4.0.RC1:  24 Dec 2008, vex r1878, valgrind r8882).\n(3.4.0:       3 Jan 2009, vex r1878, valgrind r8899).\n","ApplicationName":"Valgrind","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"EntryList":[{"entry":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.4.0","ReleaseDate":"02/01/2009","ApplicationName":"Valgrind","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"},{"entry":"3.4.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the","classification":{"str_type":"Not Classified","int_type":6},"VersionNumber":"3.4.0","ReleaseDate":"02/01/2009","ApplicationName":"Valgrind","ApplicationType":{"str_type":"Desktop","int_type":0},"flag":false,"split":false,"merged":false,"original_text":"3.4.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the"},{"entry":"usual collection of bug fixes.
