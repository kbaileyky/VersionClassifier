We_ve fixed that problem now, but if you check your sync settings and find that 1Password last synced days ago you may have been bitten by this bug. Please disable syncing and re-enable it if that_s the case. We_re terribly sorry for the trouble here.\n- Saving a new secure note no longer results in being stuck at that secure note.\n- We believe we have fixed a problem where 1Password would prompt you for your Master Password after entering your PIN code or using Touch ID. We weren't able to reproduce this one in house, but we're pretty sure we got it.\n- We fixed our number one top crasher from version 5.1.1.\n1Password never prompts you for a review.
