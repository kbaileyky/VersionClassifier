Version:
May 5, 2008
Mac OS X 10.5 or later
New Features in OmniGraffle 5
	•	New layout engine using the GraphViz code
	◦	A new layout engine has been added using the GraphViz codeset, which reproduces and enhances current hierarchical and force-directed layout options, as well as adding many other layout types and settings. We should afford as many new layouts as is reasonable given limitations of implementation, performance, and UI constraints of the Diagram Layout Inspector. The behavior of the inspector has changed to be more dynamic and change layout whenever any change is made.
	◦	There are now four different layout styles to choose from
	▪	Dot Layout: Similar to the current hierarchical layout, offers four-directional layout, rank and object separation controls.
	▪	Neato Layout: Similar to the current force-directed or web layout, offers shape overlap, line length and object separation controls.
	▪	Circo Layout: A circular layout that offers shape overlap, line length and object separation controls.
	▪	Twopi Layout: A radial layout that offers shape overlap, line length and object separation controls.
	▪	On opening of .dot files, a dialog is presented offering the different layout options.
	•	Subgraphs
	◦	Subgraphs are layout groups that abide by layout settings, yet are considered single entities that can be expanded and collapsed in diagram view as well as outline view, showing whatever hierarchy may be present. Subgraphs are a feature of OmniGraffle Professional 5.
	◦	Subgraphs can be expanded and collapsed in the diagram view.
	◦	Subgraphs can be expanded and collapsed in the outline view and show their hierarchy.
	◦	Elements in subgraphs can be connected to much as like current groups.
	•	Bezier lines
	◦	Connection lines have been given a fourth type, with bezier handles on control points. This new style is used by the new layout engine as well as by the Line Tool and Line and Shape Inspector.
	◦	Bezier controls on lines have the same interface and implementation as bezier controls on shapes.
	◦	Bezier lines will backport to previous versions of OmniGraffle as the curvy line type.
	◦	Straight and curvy line types, when converted to bezier retain their previous appearance.
	◦	Bezier lines import and export to the Visio XML format.
	•	Binary Visio file format support
	◦	OmniGraffle Professional 5 now has a built in parser to convert the binary Visio file format (VSD) to XML for import.
	◦	Visio stencils (VSS) and Visio templates (VST) are supported.
	•	Custom Data
	◦	Custom key/value pair data has been added to the Note Inspector that exposes to the UI existing object metadata as well as allowing the user to add their own.
	◦	Custom data imports and exports to the Visio XML format.
	◦	Custom data is a feature of OmniGraffle Professional 5.
	•	Shared Layers
	◦	Instead of using Master Canvases, OmniGraffle Professional 5 now has Shared Layers instead.
	▪	You can have as many shared layers on a canvas as desired.
	▪	Changes made to any shared layer dynamically propagate to all instances of the shared layer.
	▪	Objects on shared layers highlight with a different color.
	•	Inspector controls in the Ruler Accessory View
	◦	Many commonly used inspector controls are now available for use from the ruler accessory view.
	•	Diagram Tool
	◦	A drawing tool has been added that matches current functionality implemented via keystrokes and mouse input.
	◦	The Diagram Tool performs the same functionality as current Command-clicking and Command-Option-clicking the empty canvas.
	•	Presentation Mode
	◦	Navigational controls have been added to Presentation Mode, moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen will reveal them.
	•	Tools Palette
	◦	The drawing tools palette can exist in the document window toolbar as well as in a floating palette. Both versions are configurable by the user.
	◦	The drawing tools palette in the document window toolbar has a control to reveal/hide lesser used tools.
	◦	The floating tools palette has controls to change its shape and orientation.
	•	Style Tray
	◦	A Style Tray has been added to the bottom bar of the document window as well as the stencil window. This allows easier access to the particular styles of a shape for application to other shapes and objects.
	◦	The Style Tray's icons or chits can be dragged to selections to change their style.
	◦	The Style Tray works for all selectable elements.
	•	Outline Editor
	◦	The Outline Editor supports copy/paste drag/drop from OmniOutliner.
	•	Source List view for layers
	◦	Sharing the same view as the Outlne Editor is a Layer Source List, showing layers and the objects residing within them.
	◦	Layers have a disclosure triangle revealing object list in non-hierarchical form.
	◦	Objects in the list can show unique ID numbers for objects. This is a feature of OmniGraffle Professional 5.
	•	Inspectable Canvases
	◦	Canvases can now be selected like any other object, and select inspectors can apply to the selected canvases.
	•	Stencil Window changes
	◦	Stencil searching has been added, allowing searches for stencils based on stencil name and individual object metadata locally using Spotlight criteria.
	◦	You can also search for stencils at Graffletopia.com.
	◦	Stencils at Graffletopia can be downloaded from the Stencil Window.
	◦	Stencils opened that aren't in the proper location for further use can be easily installed from within the Stencil Window.
	◦	Selection and viewing of multiple stencils is now supported.
	◦	The stencil viewer now has a source list allowing viewing of multiple stencils and easier creation of stencil sets.
	▪	Creation of new folders in the source list is independent of the file system, ala playlists in iTunes.
	▪	There is a new "Favorites" category that you can add stencils to.
	◦	A style tray has been added to the stencil viewer.
	◦	A toggle has been added which switches from the normal stencil document view to a "well" display for showing complex stencils as well as search results.
	◦	A new view at the bottom of the Stencil Window shows selected items and associated custom data.
	•	Document Level Inspectors
	◦	A new group of inspectors that apply at the overall document level have been added.
	▪	The Document: Data Inspector shows traditional Spotlight information.
	▪	The Document Inspector shows file saving options and overall page margins.
	•	Export as OmniOutliner 3
	◦	OmniGraffle can now export to the OmniOutliner 3 XML format.
	•	Template Chooser
	◦	A new interface has been added to create new documents based on a template that shows what the template looks like beforehand.
	◦	New types of templates created and available based on user intent for document creation (drawing, brainstorm, org chart, etc.)
	•	New Actions
	◦	There is a new action in the Action Inspector to show, hide, or toggle visibility of any given number of layers.
	◦	This action will function in Presentation Mode.
	•	Connecting Shapes
	◦	A new stencil has been added containing special shapes that can connect between objects.
	•	UI changes
	•	Inspectors
	◦	The Canvas: Selection Inspector now has a search field.
	◦	Ruler units and scale have been moved to the Canvas: Size Inspector.
	◦	Custom data has been added to the Note Inspector in OmniGraffle Professional 5.
	◦	The Style: Image Inspector has a new set of controls and better support for cropping.
	•	Menus
	◦	The Stencils Menu is no more, you can access the Stencil Window from the Window Menu.
	◦	You can now create new resources (Stencil, Template, Diagram Style) from the File Menu.
	◦	You can export normal OmniGraffle documents as resources now.
	◦	Quite a bit of shuffling of controls to different menus has occurred, as well as the overhaul of keyboard shortcuts.
	◦	The Status Bar is no more. Fare thee well, Status Bar!
	•	Known Issues
	•	PDF files that are directly opened in OmniGraffle Professional will have any open paths converted to the new bezier line type. However, those lines will have their geometry vertically flipped and will be offset a bit.
	•	The new binary Visio parser will open Visio stencil files (VSS), however the stencil files found at Cisco's website aren't opening for some reason.

	•	Resetting inspector locations via the menu now also resets the location of the Stencil window. While the Stencil window is not an inspector, for this context it is generally appropriate to treat it as one.
	•	Fixed a bug that was resulting in crazy behavior when resizing a connecting shape that was part of a group.
	•	Some images that should have been displayed in the help for layers were instead being listed as links. These images now display inline.
	•	Fixed a bug where the Canvas variable was displaying incorrectly on thumbnails in the canvas sidebar.

	•	Fixed a bug where fill colors were being exported tom OmniOutliner files even when the fill was disabled.
	•	Fixed a bug resulting in an error message when attempting to combine accents with other characteers on a Finnish keyboard.
	•	Fixed a bug where drawing dirt was left behind when resizing a group by shifting line midpoints.
	•	Selecting the Stencils or Tool Palette items in the Window menu will now hide the corresponding window if it is already visible.
	•	Fixed a bug that could cause the canvas thumbnails to display incorrectly when a document is opened.
	•	Fixed a bug where an extraneous light grey line was drawing at the bottom of the canvas area.
	•	We believe we have fixed a bug which was preventing files from being saved if they had embedded color profiles whose names had changed or were otherwise invalid. This would show up at save time as an NSConcreteMutableData error.
	•	We believe we have fixed a problem where Software Update would not inform the user if the update required payment.
