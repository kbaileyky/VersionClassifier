Update 3
08-18-2011, 12:03 PM
Our third update for Bastion should be out now, addressing several issues reported by players as well as adding some advanced settings. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes: 

- Fixed an issue in which the game would not detect local saved data if players lost their connection to Steam cloud storage

- Fixed an issue where remapping the Left Trigger and Right Trigger gamepad controls fired the default commands unexpectedly

- Fixed an issue in Roathus Lagoon that could cause players to get locked out of the level's final area

- Added support for several advanced command-line parameters (aka Launch Options in Steam).

To set Launch Options in Steam, right-click on Bastion inyour game library, select Properties, then select Set Launch Options.

NOTE: Please be advised that these settings are recommended for advanced users and may adversely affect your game experience.

The parameters are:

-isomovement
Using the default Slinger-style WASD controls, diagonal movements will more closely adhere to the isometric perspective. We would appreciate your feedback about this change. 

-windowed
Forces the game to start in windowed mode.

-x [value]
Forces the game to a specific X resolution.

-y [value]
Forces the game to a specific Y resolution.

Example: to run the game in 1280x720 (720p) resolution:"-windowed -x 1280 -y 720"

-noborder
Runs the game in windowed mode but with no windows titlebar or border. (This may improve compatibility or performance versus full-screen mode in some cases or provide a preferable experience.)

-deadzone [value]
Allows a custom joystick dead zone for players experiencingissues with their gamepads. Value is the fraction at which input should register. Example: "-deadzone 0.4".

-lang [value]
Forces the game to load a specific text language. Available options are "en", "fr", "it","de", and "es" for English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish, respectively. Example: "-lang de"

-nofixedstep
Turns off fixed time step so that the game no longer dictates the frame rate. (This may improve performance for some users but may also lead to erratic performance in other cases.)

Thank you for playing Bastion.

Update 4
 08-19-2011, 11:03 AM
Hey, our fourth update should be out there now, once again addressing various issues reported by players as well as adding several enhancements. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes:

- Updated the default "Slinger-style" WASD controls to make the character move relative to the isometric perspective.

NOTE: In the previous update, this required using a commandline parameter "-isomovement", which is no longer necessary. To restore the original setting, use the new commandline parameter "-orthomovement".

- In-game menus now respond to right-clicking as well as left-clicking. One for the lefties!

- Added support for resolutions greater than 1920x1080, at which visual issues with the background visuals could occur.

- Fixed several issues that were causing the game to crash for some players.

- Fixed an issue in Burstone Quarry that could cause players to get locked out of the level's final area.

- Fixed an issue in Mt. Zand that could cause players to get locked out of the level's final area.

- Fixed an issue in Zulten's Hollow that caused the level's weapon pickup animation not to play.

- Fixed an issue in the Bullhead Trial where the text stated that the Gold Prize requirement involved completing the trial having taken less than two hits instead of three.

- Fixed an issue causing the opening splash screens to overlap when running the game using the "-nofixedstep" commandline parameter, which unlocks the frame rate.

- Fixed a rare issue where weapon slots at the Arsenal could become unselectable.

We plan to continue updating the game in the coming days at this cadence. Thank you for playing.

Hey, our sixth update should be deploying today. It addresses additional crash issues and also adds seven new Steam Achievements. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes:

- Fixed a rare issue in Who Knows Where sequences, in which foes could get knocked so far out of range that they would ignore the player and not return to the combat area.

- Added seven new Steam Achievements! They are:

Update 7
09-02-2011, 11:25 AM
Hey, our seventh update should be deploying today. It addresses several issues and adds support for other alphabets, enabling translations in other languages. This update will be applied automatically when players restart their Steam client. The change list includes:

- Fixed an issue that caused Secret Skills to sometimes become unselectable after successive play-throughs of the game.

- Fixed an issue that could cause the Man-at-Arms achievement not to unlock when expected.

- Fixed an issue that could cause weapon upgrades of the same tier to both become selected in the Forge.

- Fixed an issue causing Bastion.exe to not exit cleanly as intended.

- Added custom language support for alphabets based on Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, to support requests for player-created translations to other languages. To add a custom language to the game, follow these steps:

1. Determine the two-letter language code according to ISO 639-1
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

e.g. Portuguese = pt, Russian = ru, Polish = pl

The following example is for creating a Russian (ru) translation.

2. Navigate to Steam\steamapps\common\bastion\Content\Game\Text, and make a copy of HelpText.en.xml called HelpText.ru.xml.

3. Translate the text in HelpText.ru.xml from English to Russian. At the top of the file, make sure the line reads: <HelpText lang="ru">

4. Create a folder in Steam\steamapps\common\bastion\Content\Subtitles\r u

5. Copy over the files in Steam\steamapps\common\bastion\Content\Subtitles\e n, and translate them.

6. Launch the game with '-lang ru' Launch Options
(for Launch option instructions: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_...1040-JWMT-2947)

Thanks to those of you expressing interest in taking the time to create fan translations and for playing.
