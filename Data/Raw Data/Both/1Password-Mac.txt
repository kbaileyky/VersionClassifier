When a website you use is found to be at risk, 1Password Watchtower will flag your Login as vulnerable. The Watchtower service is a component of our popular Security Audit feature, which shows you weak, duplicate, and old passwords found in your Vault. With the addition of Watchtower, you can now also see all vulnerable sites in one place, then begin updating your passwords to secure your accounts.

When enabled, the 1Password Watchtower service regularly downloads a list of vulnerable domains. Your personal information is never transmitted.
