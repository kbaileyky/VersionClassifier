Version 3.0.1 Posted Oct 11. 2011 We are hard at work on the next big update to Sleep Cycle, in the meanwhile here is a minor update that fixes problems with iOS S.
Version 3.0 Posted Nov 11. 2010
Major improvements:
+ intelligent snooze
+ adjustable wake up phase length
anything from 0 minutes (regular alarm clock mode) to 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes + Sleep Cycle is now up to 5x more sensitive to your movement
this is great news because better sensitivity means better wake ups
+ no need to recalibrate Sleep Cycle when changing bed, pillow or mattress anymore
+ full support for the iPod touch
+ full iPhone 4 retina resolution support
+ possibility to use music from your iPod library as alarm sound
+ Sleep Cycle no longer mutes music or audiobooks that are playing in the background + no alarm mode
- use Sleep Cycle to graph your sleep, without using the alarm
Also improved:
+ added swipe to navigate between graphs
+ added vibration settings ("As Backup", "No vibration", "Only vibrate")
+ more detailed and smoother sleep graphs
+ improved performance
+ screen now fades to black on iPod touches when the device is placed with the glass down
+ advanced accelerometer calibration
Sleep Cycle needs one or two nights to automatically calibrate to your accelerometer
+ updated graphics for buttons and other UI elements
+ added a regular alarm clock sound in addition to the normal wake up melodies
+ if you shut down Sleep Cycle during the night and start it up again it will continue on the same graph + warning shown on nights that are too short (less than 2.5 hours)
+ warning shown on nights that Sleep Cycle has sensed no or very little movement
+ small gray line below sleep graph to indicate when the alarm window started
+ calculation of average total time is now done in background
+ possibility to log out from Facebook (button in advanced settings)
+ added a default subject line when sharing graph by email
+ removed "dreaming" from graph legend
we've done a lot of research around this with help from sleep scientists and determined that Sleep Cycle cannot reliably detect when you are in REM sleep
+ fixed bug: fixed problems with non-gregorian calendars (like thai andjapanese calendars)
+ fixed bug: AM/PM being clipped in statistics view
+ fixed bug: navigation arrows in statistics are now always correctly dimmed
+ fixed bug: correct day of week displayed in statistics
+ fixed bug: accelerometer was too sensitive on some devices producing incorrect sleep graphs this is fixed by calibrating to the accelerometer during the first two nights
+ fixed bug: when shutting off the alarm the home-button now works even if the iPhone is covered by a sheet (proximity sensor problem)
+ fixed bug: problem when posting to Facebook when user has changed Facebook password
+ fixed bug: crash when trying to share graph by email and no email accounts where set up
