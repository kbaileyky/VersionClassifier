Please read all of the changes carefully!

Changes (since 1.4.1398)
	?	IDE
	?	Multiple startup and shutdown stability fixes
	?	If GM still will not shutdown correctly, please send details, PC specs and %appdata%\GameMaker-Studio\traceIDE.log to helpdesk
	?	Renaming all resources now works like scripts have for a few versions, so the name is only checked on enter key/close window
	?	Dragging-dropping a .gmez or .gex will import the extension rather than add to Included Files
	?	You can now duplicate tabbed scripts
	?	Help > Open Tutorial Panel is hidden if the project is not a tutorial - this is not a link to the Tutorials download form
	?	Build date and time constants have been moved from the IDE to the asset compiler, so are automatic now
	?	GM_build_date returns a UNIX-style time (i.e. number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970) for when that compile took place
	?	GM_version is now per-platform and shows the GGS version value
	?	If you have Macro values already they will be respected, but you can now remove the ones in Macros if you want
	?	Fixes for flipx/flipy when moving a flipped object in the room editor, also origin when adding more images to sprite
	?	Stopped resource/filenames with the word "error" in them throwing false compile errors even though build okay
	?	Confirmation dialogue now shown when dragging in many resources, gives option to cancel
	?	Studio will no longer open any "sub" .gmx files - it will accept the proper .project.gmx only
	?	Previewing a .ogg sound will now open your default .ogg music player to play the sound (if specified in Preferences)
	?	Several fixes for .lib files in your extensions being imported correctly
	?	Windows 8 publisher name in GGS is now actually passed to your game manifest
	?	New debugger should always give a meaningful line number
	?	New debugger now has a preference for setting whether you will specify the device IP to connect to, rather than GM querying the device

	?	GameMaker: Marketplace is now available to Steam users also!
	?	You can now create a Marketplace account using your Steam User ID instead of a GM: S license
	?	Extension ownership check fixed

	?	Has been updated on Android, iOS and HTML5 to use the latest SDK
	?	NOTE: This does raise this minimum iOS version currently supported to be 5.0
	?	Now requires extra FB information to be entered into GGS, otherwise it will not initialise (prevents crashes)
	?	Only adds into your manifest when GGS is actually set to use FB
	?	iOS 8 Support
	?	NOTE: You should now update to Xcode 6 ("Gold Master" is fine also)
	?	v1398 only had runner support for iOS 8, now you can create applications also
	?	NOTE: You must enable Preferences > Developer > "Enable UI Automation" on your iOS 8 iDevice, otherwise build "fails"
	?	See >this FAQ for more iOS 8 issues/info
	?	Fixes also added for when there is a space in your project name, stops Facebook SDK not found to be unzipped errors also.
	?	HTML5
	?	Several performance optimisations/fixes, especially when your game had no views or only a single view

	?	Fix for file_text_open_from_string()
	?	Fix for keyboard_last_key on Mac OS X
	?	Another fix added for using asset_get_index() with sound files

Version 1.4.1398
13/08/2014 15:03
Welcome to the first 1.4 release!

You'll find the Marketplace is now open to everyone, some major IDE improvements, plus a huge list of fixes over EA182. Changes are given in brief below, but you can read more in this Tech Blog and almost all are in EA releases already). Please note that some of the features listed below require Pro+ licenses.

Changes (since 1.3.1386)
	?	IDE Changes
	?	Tree filtering allows you to search for resources and see only the location of matching results.
	?	Tabbed scripts allows you to split large scripts into tabs and call each tab like a normal script, but with only one resource tree entry.
	?	Bookmarks can now be added to lines of code in scripts and code actions (new in this version). Ctrl+shift+[number] to set, Ctrl+[number] to open later.
	?	Creating extensions now has a quick "wizard" style format. Create extension, choose optional platforms, then right-click and "Add Placeholder".
	?	Fonts now can be set whether you want to include custom font files with the project when exporting, etc.
	?	Objects now have a list of any children on their properties form. Can jump to the parent/child directly.
	?	Selecting an object instance in the creation order list for the room editor will "move camera" to instance location.
	?	GameMaker: Marketplace
	?	You now have access to the GameMaker: Marketplace Beta. You'll find a new menubar entry for this.
	?	Any user can browse and purchase.
	?	Creating a publisher account to sell your assets requires a Pro license or above. (Paid Standard users are fine also.)
	?	More info on the Knowledge Base in the Marketplace category
	?	Extensions
	?	The workflow for creating extensions has changed to a bit more of a "wizard" style.
	?	If you choose iOS/Android we automatically create placeholders and the folder structure for you.
	?	Code is then selected via a file selector and copied into the correct project subfolder.
	?	If an extension isn't marked valid on a platform we will generate blank "stub" functions for you automatically during compile.
	?	Changed the Init and Final edit boxes to be combo boxes populated from the given functions.
	?	Warnings:
	?	Because of the Marketplace, extensions have far more protection than they did previously - specifically who authored and who has permission to use.
	?	If you are not the author and have not bought the extension off the Marketplace you will be unable to create an executable of that project!
	?	Image Editor (Pro/Master users only - except for the last one)
	?	Custom colour palletes are now able to be created. MMB on pallete to set a custom colour. They can then be saved and loaded.
	?	Image window now allows for "onion-skinning" to show previous/next sprite images as well as current, useful for animations.
	?	Image preview can also be toggled into a small/large preview. Double click on preview.
	?	Right mouse button can be set to the eraser rather than a second paint colour. Right click on eraser.
	?	Pressing J toggles a temporary "Spare Page" to edit copy/paste parts of your images.
	?	MMB or holding space bar while mousing will pan the image.
	?	SVN tools updated
	?	Now support 1.7 and 1.8 workspaces. Toggle which tools to use in File > Preferences.
	?	Also allow you to specify your own SVN tools.
	?	Warning: If your workspace is 1.6 or older you will be asked to update it.
	?	SVN integration is also now only used if the project has SVN set for use in GGS.
	?	Liquidfun physics
	?	As well as updating the Box2D already included, you now get particle physics and several more physics shapes to use.
	?	Warning: Please test physics games very thoroughly after updating!
	?	Misc
	?	Can now cancel local notifications. Can also now get a list of pending local notifications and step through them.
	?	Anti-aliasing has been added for SWF files. draw_enable_swf_aa... (Requires Pro).</li
	?	Many updates and fixes for Spine importing, plus new skeleton_animation_list(), skeleton_skin_list(), skeleton_slot_data()
	?	Buffers for surfaces.
	?	date_get_timezone()/date_set_timezone() toggle UTC/local for the other date and time functions.
	?	Updates and fixes for the new debugger.
	?	audio_play_music() is now obsolete, use audio_play_sound() instead.
	?	Lots of fixes for HTML5 audio, especially when using emitters.
	?	Added checks to ensure that sprite mask generation is done within the size of each individual image, not a fixed size.
	?	iOS 8 Beta games no longer use Document directory for save area, switch to using the Application Support area.
	?	Note: Support for iOS 8 Beta is runner-only at the moment. Xcode Beta is not tested.
	?	Background images added via DnD won't point at original location any more and import as just the name of the image.
	?	Android landscape and landscape-flipped are now correct again if you chose only one orientation.

Version 1.3.1373
28/07/2014 11:16
Please read the release notes carefully!
NOTE: GameMaker: Marketplace is not in this release - it will not reach Stable for some time!

Changes (Since v1354 - if you have EA170+ you already have all these and more)
	?	Free/Standard (for free) users, please note:
	?	SWF and Spine functionality is available only to those on old Standard licenses (non-free) and Pro/Master users.
	?	Spine functions have always been Pro/Master users only, so now bringing both resource types into line.
	?	The GM: S logo splash screen always applied to Free license users now applies to Standard (for free) also, as there is no more Free license.
	?	Similarly, the "Made with GameMaker: Studio" window title has now been applied to Standard (for free) users.
	?	Android SDK Tools
	?	If you have already updated to the latest API for Android you'll see they have moved zipalign and this breaks making .apks.
	?	This version has a fix for supporting the old and new locations for the tool.
	?	IDE Changes
	?	Lots of fixes for floating windows disappearing behind the main window.
	?	Rooms create at the default of 1024x768 now, not 640x480.
	?	Compiler errors reference the object and link to its properties as well as go to the line mentioned.
	?	The same for "Search in Scripts". If it's an in-built var or function you can also jump to the manual from here.
	?	Progress report in the compiler log window when processing SWFs.
	?	The pre-multiplied alpha button in the image editor now works properly.
	?	Will prompt you to rename .gmzs with invalid characters in the filename, rather than failing to load.
	?	Using an external image editor in Preferences works again.
	?	Holding Ctrl in the Image Editor will toggle to the colour picker for more brush types now.
	?	Room editor correctly checks if backgrounds inside a group are individually marked as tilesets or not.
	?	Timeline code windows can no longer "unlink" the moment from the timeline.
	?	License validation error screen link now points to the correct helpdesk FAQ.
	?	Macros
	?	"Constants" in the IDE have now been renamed "Macros" so they are more appropriately-named.
	?	An end result must still be able to be calculated at build time, but this makes it clearer that they are not static.
	?	Enums
	?	Enums can now be created using a C-style format like: enum MYENUM { ENUM1, ENUM2, ENUM3 }; myVariable = MYENUM.ENUM1;
	?	In-Game
	?	Win 8 N games will scale according to GGS setting correctly again.
	?	YYC builds have a fix for running .dll extensions.
	?	Multiple precise sprites will have a "merged precise" mask again, like pre v1.2 releases.
	?	room_dulicate() now creates a unique room reference, so it's now not incorrectly linked to the duplicated one.
	?	Window co-ords to view co-ords calculations will ignore hidden views or those which have a surface attached.
	?	The above change might mean that the view with a surface might require a drawing code change in your project.
	?	os_browser identifies IE11 now.
	?	surface_reset_target() restoring correct previous GUI size, not reset to defaults.
	?	New constants for the draw events which didn't have one.
	?	Fix for one extension function calling another.
	?	script_exists() is now supported on JS platforms.
	?	Date and Time
	?	date_get_timezone()/date_set_timezone() toggle UTC/local for the other date and time functions.
	?	Push Notifications
	?	Can now cancel local notifications.
	?	Can also now get a list of pending local notifications and step through them.
	?	Misc
	?	Lots of optimisations for when the IDE loads in audio and sprites, etc., to keep memory usage down.
	?	Lots of compiler optimisations to speed up builds.
	?	New isometric game demo has been added.
	?	New extension-creation demo has been added.
	?	Xcode and your Keychain are now gracefully released after an iOS/iOS YYC build.
	?	Windows 8 compiles will find your actual Win 8 advertising SDK installed version, not a forced value.

Version 1.3.1354
12/06/2014 11:04 
Please read the release notes carefully!

Changes (Since v1344)
	?	Misc Changes
	?	If you close an object's properties any code actions belonging to that object will close also (to stop duplicate code windows issue).
	?	Compiler window should be more responsive when outputting lots of debug/build text.
	?	Fix for how frequently licensing was being triggered in some cases.
	?	Licensing dialogues now detect non-Studio keys and block you using them (will tell you why).
	?	Fix for Windows 8 target image if you do not have that module.
	?	Ad Provider Demos v2
	?	You may have noticed we've released updated demos in the Ad Providers category - they will now say v2 in the description.
	?	To update your installed copy you will first need to delete the old copy from %appdata%\GameMaker-Studio\demo then download new.
	?	You'll see updated function details, lots more functionality, and some expanded documentation in the readme and the comments throughout.
	?	Same as before - test using the demo, then export a .gmez of the extension and import that into your own game.
	?	For more information and an expanded how-to please see this Helpdesk article
	?	Documentation Changes
	?	Updates to match the new Standard-is-free situation to the manual.
	?	Note that the manual assumes all Standard licenses are the new unpaid type - if you have Mac & Windows 8 already, you will keep them.
	?	Numerous fixes to function docs. (Not all covered in the lists below.)
	?	Several small fixes for demos/tutorials.

Please read the release notes carefully!

Changes (Since v1336)

Version 1.3.1336
01/05/2014 13:01 
Please read the release notes carefully!

Changes (Since v1307 - EA97 has almost all of these and more)
	?	Application Surface Changes
	?	WARNING: We have changed the GUI layer to fit to the application surface by default. Coming from 1.2, the GUI will likely be positioned as you expect, but projects amended in 1.3/EA to reposition GUI text, etc., might now need changing again.
	?	display_set_gui_size() can make the GUI the application_surface size if you already modified your project for 1.3 and want it to work like a 1.2
	?	display_set_gui_maximise() makes your game continue to act like a 1.3 project has done up until now.
	?	Using display_set_gui_maximise() you can also introduce and offset and scaling, which can be applied per-draw event to allow moving UIs, hiding stuff off-screen, etc.
	?	IDE Changes
	?	All windows can now be made floating and taken outside the IDE. The preference has now changed from "pop out code windows" to "pop out windows".
	?	While GM is open each resource will save its own location and size on close, but shutting down GM will only keep the last 10 windows (for now).
	?	You may see some flickering as editor windows open/close (for now).
	?	There is now a limit of 64 windows open at any one time - you'll get a warning popup if you attempt to open more.
	?	Room editor Instance Order list now features the resource type appended to the ID, highlights the instance in the room, and allows rename/delete/edit/creation code.
	?	Room editor Views tab has options for turning off background clearing, which can be used for boosting performance - especially with Android slowdown.
	?	If you keep the aspect ratio in your game, you probably don't want to disable the "Clear Display Buffer" one.
	?	The existing option to turn off filling the background with a colour is still also effective in raising performance.
	?	Lots of tooltips have been added/restored, especially in GGS.
	?	With "pop out windows" ON, just the news window needs to not be maximised. Pop-outs OFF, maximising windows will still break.
	?	Search-and-replace across script/tabs.
	?	Now remembers the last-used folder when saving out executables and resources. This is per-resource. (Not in EA97)
	?	Buttons in Preferences to clean your cache and temp folders. You can also set GM to silently clean Temp on shutdown via the checkbox. (Not in EA97)
	?	Debugger Change
	?	A profiler has been added, so you can see where bottlenecks are occuring. Can show your GML + engine calls. See this Tech Blog for more info.
	?	Many changes to HTML5 underlying functionality
	?	HTML5 has had a series of quite extensive changes, so please test your game very thoroughly.
	?	The performance fixes in the Helpdesk pre-release v1312 are in this EA also.
	?	Extensions Changes and Ad Providers
	?	WARNING: iOS and Android now use extensions for all ad providers - the GGS screens will be removed soon and our functions (ads_enable(), etc.) do nothing.
	?	We provide a small demo for each ad provider in a new Demos feed. Download the demo, see how it works, then export the .gmez for use in your own project.
	?	Right now, only the basic functionality is exposed - their SDK will likely contain more, but you would have to add the function yourself.
	?	Please see the readme inside each demo for specific info.
	?	More platforms added. See this Tech Blog for more info.
	?	Dummy files and folders are now added for you when creating a new file, or via "Add Placeholder" on the right-click menu.
	?	Added in options to allow different extension types and extension code stored on your Mac.
	?	Analytics have not been done in the new system yet and so are not functional on iOS still.
	?	If you're not doing Android/iOS everything is as before - you do not need to use the new extensions for your ads.
	?	Misc
	?	Android surface performance has been greatly improved, but you should always be aware of the surface size you're creating and keep it reasonable.
	?	The pre-draw event will still get a performance hit, but not as bad as before. Where possible, move code to draw/post-draw for best performance.
	?	If your code hits an error because of using noone as an invalid comparison type you will now get a code error dialogue instead of silently ignoring.
	?	show_debug_message() will now silently string() reals for you, the same as show_message() has always done.
	?	WARNING: We've updated GGS Android icons to match current requirements. You must re-add your icons, otherwise they will be "Broken" or default images. (Not in EA97)
	?	Demos and Tutorials
	?	A few new tutorials for the application surface, plus many of the others have been updated.
	?	All demos and tutorials have been renamed to take out the spaces in the project names. This does mean you will have to rename or re-download the files.
	?	Please note some of the older tutorials and demos are either updated and renamed or are just gone as they have been replaced.
	?	If you want tabbed code editors and the ability to create code bookmarks, or the updated physics engine using LiquidFun, please download EA97.

Version 1.3.1307
14/03/2014 15:09 
****** Welcome to the first v1.3 beta! *****

Changes (In summary - if you've been using Early Access versions you'll already know most of these)
	?	Please see our recent Tech Blogs / Helpdesk FAQs for more info on new features! This is very important!
	?	Rewritten and updated IAP system for all platforms which support IAPs
	?	New native code extensions system for iOS, Android and Mac
	?	Push notifications on iOS, Android and Tizen (not WP8 or Win 8 yet)
	?	Much more powerful cross-platform debugger
	?	Native platforms only at the moment
	?	Win 8N requires you to snap your game, not hide it!
	?	application_surface cross-platform drawing method
	?	Be aware your game may look odd until you change custom draw code values
	?	Keep Aspect Ratio works on all platforms now
	?	GUI is 1:1 with the window/device size unless you change it - very important when keep aspect ratio enabled
	?	iOS now builds the same as iOS YYC:
	?	Now using Xcode 5 to handle more of the build process.
	?	Please see the compiler log any time you're advised of a build failure - often it worked fine, but wasn't automatically launched on iDevice
	?	Your iDevice should be plugged into your Mac at the time if you want to deploy the wifi runner/test via USB.
	?	You don't make your own runner using the application oven - we generate a custom runner for the game (so ads/IAPs, etc., work in test now)
	?	Always use dev cert in GGS, otherwise Instruments/iTunes/IPCU won't install your game
	?	Distribute to the store via Xcode > Organizer (which is where you specify distribution, etc.)
	?	Distribute to enterprise/ad-hoc via Xcode > Organizer if you want an .ipa (we return an .xarchive purely for backing-up, not .ipa now!)
	?	Flash .SWF files can be imported as sprites
	?	Spine .json files can be imported as sprites on native platforms (JS soon) - you will need to agree to a Spine EULA if you want to use this
	?	Mac OS X 10.6 compatability has been restored
	?	An extra DS accessor for modifying arrays by value
	?	
	?	For iOS builds only, this release has iAds only and no analytics - the other providers will come back as extensions as we develop/update them
	?	(And remember to update the wifi Runner on Android to the latest version if required)

	?	example "/// OutlineText(x,y,text,colour1,colour2)"
	?	draw_getpixel_ext() and surface_getpixel_ext() now return ALPHA as well. So the FULL 32bits are now returned.
	?	matrix_get(), matrix_set(), matrix_build(), matrix_multiply() have been added, interim documentation is here
	?	limit of 32,000 entries has been removed on 1D arrays, this does come with the caveat that if array is over 32,000 entries then array_length_1D() will not give the correct answer, this will be fixed in the future

	?	Fixed iOS issues when uploading to the App Store
	?	Included TTF fonts are now allowed in non-WebGL HTML5 / JavaScript targets

04/10/2013 15:45 
Changes
	?	Tutorials and Demos are now downloaded from our servers, reduces installer size - allows us to add many more tutorials and demos
	?	Uses an RSS feed to get the information, allows other feeds to be added
	?	Users can create their own RSS feed for their own Tutorials and Demos
	?	16 New Tutorials added that cover a variety of subjects from getting started, through touch controls to ads and facebook integration.
	?	FreeType has been added to rendered fonts from a ttf file - add ttf file to the Included files and use font_add() to create a font from it at a specified size. Currently the bold and italic parameters do nothing and the first, last params are ignored. Glyphs are cached at runtime so only impact on first use, cache is held on a 512x512 texture so size will be limited at present.
	?	NOTE : Native only, does not work in HTML5/JavaScript environments at present (support will come using WebFonts)
	?	NOTE : Further support will be added over next few releases
	?	iOS 7 support added - new icons can be added to iOS projects
	?	iOS 7 Gamepad support added for the new Apple Game Controller API - We do not have any controllers though yet so we cannot test on real hardware, let us know how you get on
	?	XCode 5.0 is now required for building iOS projects - see http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/26805787-Updating-Your-Mac-To-Use-Xcode-5 for more info
	?	new function os_get_info(), this is a Work In Progress and will be expanded in the future - returns a ds_map that has further information for the current OS
	?	NOTE : Only for Android and iOS just now (further support added over next few releases)
	?	NOTE : Each OS has different information do not expect (or rely on) the same entries for each OS
	?	Windows 8 charms can now be set using XAML rather than just HTML - see win8_settingscharm_add_xaml_*() functions
	?	Audio is now only converted to MP3 and Ogg when required - required for JavaScript targets (HTML5, Tizen and Windows 8) or if Compressed option selected (only converts to Ogg)
	?	Android Facebook SDK updated to v3.0.1

Version 1.2.1135
13/09/2013 18:01 
Changes
	?	Bug fixes and stability issues addressed
	?	New fatal runtime error added when accessing an argument[] that has not been passed into a script.
	?	Support for multiple render targets on Direct X 11 targets is now enabled, Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8
	?	Added support for x86 and Mips targets on Android YYC, also honours the selected architectures in Global Game Settings - only compiles the required ones
	?	Android YYC separated the WAD from the executable so only 1 copy of the game data if multiple architectures selected
	?	Tizen IAP client updated for both Native and Javascript for (IAP Client TPK vertion 1.0.7)
	?	ds_exists(ind, type) function added to allow check to see if given index for a data structure type exists (see documentation)
	?	physics_fixture_bind() now returns a fixture index for the instance the fixture is bound to, allowing the user to have control over the bound fixture's physical state and to allow the user to remove specific fixtures from an instance. NB: when a fixture is bound the instance makes a copy of that fixture, so the index returned by physics_fixture_bind() refers to a different fixture than that created by physics_fixture_create().
	?	Additional physics functions have been added:
	?	physics_remove_fixture()
	?	physics_fixture_bind_ext()
	?	physics_set_friction/densitiy/restitution() for a bound fixture.
	?	physics_get_friction/density/restitution() for a bound fixture.
	?	object_get_physics()

Version 1.1.1076
23/07/2013 12:18 
Changes
	?	Android YoYo Compiler has been added - requires the Android NDK to be installed which can be downloaded from here
	?	Ogg playback for sound has been enabled
	?	Sound dialog has been modified to give user control over sound formats that are used
	?	All audio is now stored in the asset cache, so it will be recreated initially on first run
	?	All sound is converted now, the original format is not used on the target device
	?	This includes WAV files
	?	Settings are on a per-Config basis
	?	Instance Creation Order UI has now been added, giving control over the order that instances are created within a room, this allows you to guarantee the order of instance creation.
	?	Steam Integration is now public - Once games are accepted onto Steam we now provide integration for acheivements, leaderboards, cloud and much much more!
	?	PlayHaven support is now public - see documentation, a PlayHaven account is required
	?	Default configuration graphics have been reduced in size
	?	GameMaker 8.1 export has been removed, as GameMaker:Studio is no longer compatible with GM8.1 in many areas, maintaining this export has become a nightmare - we have decided to remove it completely
	?	sprite_create_from_screen(), background_create_from_screen() and sprite_add_from_screen() have now been obsoleted, due to many rendering and timing issues - use the _from_surface() versions as these work correctly
	?	Shader support has been enhanced
	?	Arrays of uniforms can now be set - use shader_set_uniform_i_array(), shader_set_uniform_f_array() and shader_set_uniform_matrix_array()
	?	Setting of texture repeat and interpolation modes is now set on all texture slots.
	?	Added new functions to set texture repeat and interpolation modes on individual slots texture_set_repeat_ext() and texture_set_interpolation_ext().
	?	Added new function to get the texture of a font - font_get_texture()
	?	Added new function to get u,v coordinates of sprites, backgrounds and fonts - sprite_get_uvs(), background_get_uvs() and font_get_uvs()
	?	Added new function shader_enable_corner_id() see documentation for further details
	?	Custom vertex types have been added - allowing extra types to be used in custom vertex formats
	?	Shader example has been extended to show some of the newer features
	?	vertex_rgba() has been renamed to vertex_argb() to give normal D3D format colour support, where A=$ff000000,R=$ff0000,G=$ff00 and B=$ff

Version 1.1.1058
01/07/2013 16:20 
Changes
	?	Shaders Beta!
	?	Available on MOST platforms that support them Windows Desktop, Mac OSX, Linux, iOS, Android, Tizen, HTML5 (WebGL only), currently unsupported on Windows 8 (Javascript/Native) and Windows Phone 8
	?	New simple shader Demo
	?	See documentation for shader_* functions and vertex_* for dynamic vertex creation
	?	Currently shader compile errors are shown when shader is set (shader_set()) - see console output for error
	?	On Windows Shaders are compiled to the highest version number supported, which may be different on other machines, this may cause visual differences or shaders may not compile
	?	On some windows desktop target machines we have found that shaders will not compile correctly - this can easily be fixed by ensuring that the Direct X End User runtime is up to date on the target machines installer here
	?	NOTE: Compile errors have wrong line number because a preamble is prefixed to your shader, and on Windows the shader is converted to HLSL where the line numbers may not match in any case
	?	NOTE: This is a BETA so there will be bugs.
	?	NOTE: Currently arrays of uniforms cannot be set on a shader, this functionality will be provided in a future version
	?	NOTE: Not all Android devices support shaders so it may NOT work on your device.
	?	NOTE: A function is coming that will query shader support but its not here yet.
	?	YoYo Compiler Beta!
	?	Currently only available on Windows Desktop
	?	New Windows Preferences (in File -> Preferences) needs to be setup correctly before compiler will work properly - defaults are setup for Visual Studio 2012 Express Desktop edition, these will need changed for other configurations, an FAQ on configurations can be found here
	?	Requires a linker and Windows SDK to be installed for it to work properly, the easiest way to get that is to install Visual Studio Express which is free, though if you have Visual Studio Professional this will work too
	?	Windows 8 or Windows 7 : The Visual Studio 2012 Express Desktop Edition needs to be installed first from here
	?	Windows Vista or Windows XP : The Visual Studio 2010 Express C++ Edition needs to be installed first from here
	?	To build with the Compiler simply select the Windows (YYC) target from the drop down menu and then Test
	?	NOTE: Currently Debugger does not work with compiler just yet, if selected it will actually run as normal VM
	?	NOTE: Create executable is disabled during BETA period
	?	NOTE: The FPS display is meant to be on screen ALL the time during the BETA period
	?	NOTE: game_save() and game_load() do not work properly with the compiler at this time.
	?	NOTE: if scripts are called with the wrong number of arguments then the game will crash at this time.
	?	NOTE: This is a BETA so there will be bugs.
	?	HTML5 3D Beta!
	?	WebGL only - not implemented for canvas
	?	Currently d3d_model_load() and d3d_model_save() do NOT work.
	?	Currently cube demo does NOT work without reducing the number of cubes, we are investigating...
	?	NOTE: This is a BETA so there will be bugs.
	?	NOTE: These are in BETA so there will be bugs - File bugs using the link in Help -> Report a bug.

Version 1.1.1013 - BETA
23/05/2013 17:11 
Changes
	?	Stable/Beta channel now active again.
	?	Tizen HTML5 and Native beta released! Testing only.
	?	Google Play Game Services have been added to Android, and can be enabled from Android's Global Game Settings
	?	Missing texture options for sprites have been added in for STANDRD users.
	?	Arrays can now be passed/returned from scripts.
	?	NOT pass by reference
	?	If array values are set, then the array is copied
	?	Arrays are now native on HTML5, making them significantly quicker.
	?	Arrays can now be freed!
	?	To free an array, simply set the variable to 0 (if MyVar was an array, MyVar=0 would free it)
	?	3 new array functions added
	?	is_array()
	?	array_length_1d() gives the size of the 1st dimension
	?	array_length_2d() gives the size of the 2nd dimension. Arrays are ragged, not grids. so the each element of the 2nd dimension varys in size
