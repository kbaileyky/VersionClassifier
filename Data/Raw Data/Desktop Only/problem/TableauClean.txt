This release contains a critical security update that addresses the Heartbleed security issue.

Heartbleed is a critical security vulnerability in the OpenSSL library (version 1.0.1). OpenSSL is an open source software that is used by many websites and software products, including some Tableau products. The Heartbleed vulnerability allows a remote attacker to read client or server application memory. This can allow for encryption keys to be read, which can enable the decrypting of data obtained by intercepting traffic. For more details on Tableau’s updates for this issue, the Tableau products that are affected, and how to upgrade Tableau, see the Heartbleed Issue Knowledge Base article.

This release is an important update to address the following product issues in Tableau 8.1 and 8.1.1.

All Salesforce extracts that were created in 8.0, 8.1, or 8.1.1 or were upgraded to these versions may contain corrupt or inaccurate data. Refreshing the extracts using Tableau 8.1.2 corrects the issue. Scheduled and manual refreshes will be forced to become a full refresh initially. Subsequent refreshes will return to incremental as originally specified.

In Tableau Desktop, you will be prompted to refresh Salesforce extracts before continuing to use the workbook. Make sure to save the workbook to ensure correct data when the workbook is opened again later.

On Tableau Server, original views will remain available with inaccurate data until the extracts are refreshed.

Discontinued support for connecting to Greenplum 3.3.


Version 7.0.19 released October 8, 2013.
Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
When publishing a CSV file as a data source, clearing the "Include External Files" option would not work the same as when publishing that data source as part of a workbook. This issue made the data unable to refresh.

Modifying filters when connected to an Essbase 11.1.2. cube, could cause an MDX syntax error, “"Essbase database error 1260052: Syntax error in input MDX query on line (variable) at token '(variable)'.".



Version 7.0.18 released August 27, 2013.
Corrected Issues

Enhanced security support for Tableau Server's PostgreSQL database.

Improved filter action behavior in Tableau Desktop.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
An "Incorrect data type" error would sometimes occur in Tableau Server in workbooks that connected to SAP BW data sources. This problem has been fixed.

Addressed an issue in Tableau Desktop where editing location to add longitude and latitude caused Desktop to become inoperable.

Fixed an issue in Tableau Desktop where Menu Filter Actions were inadvertently cleared when scrolling twice or clicking marks.

Tableau Server
In a distributed server environment, some VizQL processes would appear to be underutilized and others appeared overutilized causing "Out of memory" errors.

The error "Tableau Exception: Could not send Query (connection dead)" would sometimes display when accessing a published workbook that connects to an Amazon Redshift data source. 


Version 7.0.15 released May 6, 2013.
Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
It was possible for an extract refresh to succeed even though the refresh query failed. This resulted in an empty extract (zero records). An error message has been added to indicate that the refresh didn't succeed and the original extract was not refreshed.

Adding very large background images could cause the application to exit. If the background image cannot be rendered, a message now displays indicating that the image is too large.

The data source connection list at the top of the Data window would not show a scroll bar when there were more than 30 connections in the workbook.

Opening a workbook that uses an SSL Generic ODBC connection to a PostgreSQL database would fail with a "no password supplied" error instead of prompting for credentials.

Tableau Server
Parameter values would not always show the "Display as" value when viewed on the web.

Optimized performance to decrease the amount of time it takes to open the Users list as an administrator.

Extract refreshes for text files would fail if the original text file and the extract file were stored in the same directory.

Restarting the server while an extract refresh is running would result in the refresh incorrectly showing as successful in the Background Tasks administrative view.

Favorites were not working in Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9 on servers that had Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) enabled.

Refreshing very large extracts could fail with a "The system cannot find the path specified" error.

In environments where the Data Engine is run on a worker machine, taking an unsafe backup while an extract refresh is running would fail.

Known Open Issues
When creating a calculated field, using an IF expression that contains a â€˜parameterâ€™ type with an ISMEMBEROF function may cause an error, or in some cases may cause Tableau to unexpectedly close. If you encounter this issue, replace the ISMEMBEROF function with a calculated field that recreates the ISMEMBEROF function. 

Example:
IF ISMEMBEROF([parameter]) THEN [parameter] ELSE â€œOtherâ€? END

In the above formula, replace ISMEMBEROF([parameter]) with the name of a new calculated field that contains the formula: ISMEMBEROF([parameter]). The formula above would change to:

IF [calculated-field] THEN [parameter] ELSE â€œOtherâ€? END 




Version 7.0.14 released March 20, 2013.
New Capabilities
Tableau now supports the Vertica 6.1 driver for for Vertica 6 and higher.

Tableau now supports connections to Amazon Redshift data.

Tableau now supports connections to DB2 version 10.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
The version validation performed when connecting to SAPÂ® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW) was incorrectly identifying some versions as not meeting the required minimum of version 7.0.

Paper size now defaults to A4 for printing to PDF when the Measurement System is set to Metric in Control Panel > Region and Language > Formats tab > Additional settings > Measurement system.

Reference lines for totals would not appear in views with two continuous axes where one axis was a continuous date.

An issue with connecting to Vertica 5.1 with the 5.1 driver has been resolved. Tableau now uses the 4.1 driver instead of the 5.1 driver for Vertica 5.1 and lower. This change is based on advice from Vertica.

Optimized performance related to Oracle metadata queries.

Tableau stopped responding after opening workbook with ATTR aggregation on Color.

Optimized performance by eliminating the retrieval of metadata for the first table presented in the Single Table list. The metadata is now retrieved after a table is selected.

Tableau Server
Viewing a workbook that connects to a Tableau Server data source that is set up to "prompt user" for authentication, would sometimes succeed with an incorrect username if it was paired with the exact same password that was used when publishing the original data source.

A 404 error was returned by Internet Explorer when opening a view with authentication set to "prompt user."

Very large vizqlserver logs were being generated with multidimensional data sources.

Embedded views in dashboards were not always displaying correctly in Internet Explorer 9.

Quick filter parameters in a url for a workbook using a Microsoft Analysis Services data source were not being passed to the workbook.

Tabadmin restore was checking the available free space on the drive where the backup was located, rather than on the drive where the temp directory used for the restore, service.temp.dir, was located.

Editing multiple data connections to the same data source with Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) authentication caused "Failed to edit keychain of Workbook" error.

Some subgroups were not being synchronized when a tabadmin syncgroup was executed. The issue was when synchronized nested Active Directory groups with members of sub-groups having the same name but on different levels on the tree.

A Ruby on Rails patch to address Denial of Service and Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability in JSON has been applied. For details on this patch, see this discussion in the Ruby on Rails Google Group.

It was possible to connect to the Tableau Server PostgreSQL database using a blank password. The jdbc.password value is now the only value that is accepted.


Version 7.0.13 released February 4, 2013.
On January 28th, the team behind the Ruby on Rails framework announced critical security vulnerabilities that affect Tableau Server version 7.0 and later. Ruby on Rails is an open source web development framework that is used by Tableau Server. You can read more about these vulnerabilities at http://weblog.rubyonrails.org. The Ruby on Rails team has released corrections to these vulnerabilities in Rails versions 3.0.20 and 2.3.16. Tableau has integrated these corrections into Tableau Server 7.0.13.

Tableau strongly recommends upgrading to Tableau Server version 7.0.13 as soon as possible.

The above corrections are the only changes in this release. Tableau Server 7.0.13 is the same product as version 7.0.12 except for these corrections. Tableau Desktop 7.0.13 has not changed and is identical to version 7.0.12.




Version 7.0.12 released January 11, 2013.
New Capabilities
This release includes an important security patch for Tableau Server version 7.0 and higher. The patch addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails code, an open source web development framework that is a component of the Tableau Server architecture.

Tableau strongly recommends upgrading to Tableau Server version 7.0.12 as soon as possible. For a detailed description of the vulnerabilities, see the Ruby on Rails website: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org

Added support for the modulo operator (%) in calculated field formulas for the following data sources: DB2, Firebird, Generic ODBC, SAP Hana, Cloudera Hadoop, InterSystems Cache, MySQL, Netezza, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Teradata, VectorWise, and Vertica.

Added support in Tableau Server for Aster Database Release 5.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Using filled maps and fields with table calculations could cause the error "The query results are missing a tuple required for computing totals." This issue has been corrected.

When connected to Microsoft SQL Server, converting a text column to the FLOAT data type using a calculated field would sometimes result in an error message and other times not depending on the fields used in the view. This issue has been corrected and Tableau now returns the error message consistently when the conversion fails.

Some dashboards that connect to Oracle data sources would load slower in version 7.0.4 and later than they did in previous versions. Performance improvements were made so these dashboards are no longer slower.

Manual sort order and groups would be discarded after closing and reopening a workbook even after saving. This issue occurred when connecting to Microsoft SQL Server data sources that have a collation that is different than the column collation. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to Oracle databases, Tableau now correctly returns private synonyms as items that can be included in a connection.

Improved performance for some workbooks that contained a large number of table calculations. The workbooks could take several minutes to save. Saving these workbooks now takes less time.

When using the generic ODBC connector to connect to DB2 databases, joining multiple tables would sometimes fail and the OK button in the dialog box would be inactive. This issue was caused by failing discovery queries. This issue has been corrected by turning on a CAP_SUPPRESS_DISCOVERY_QUERIES flag.

The find field search box in the Data window would sometimes lose the first character typed in as the search string. This issue has been corrected.

The application would sometimes unexpectedly exit due to a field that was no longer part of the data source was still incorrectly included in a filter. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to data using a Custom SQL connection, the CAP_SUPPRESS_DISCOVERY_QUERIES property was not being completely followed and discovery queries were still issued incorrectly. This issue has been corrected.

Workbooks that connect to Microsoft SQL Server databases that have DATETIME2 fields that were saved on a machine with SQL Server 2012 drivers would cause an error when opening the workbook on a machine that has the SQL Server 2008R2 drivers installed. This issue has been corrected. If you connect to a data source using DATETIME2, Tableau now sets a minimum-driver-version attribute in the workbook connection. When opening the workbook any driver that satisfies that minimum requirement will work. If your driver does not meet the minimum requirement you will get an error message.

Connecting to Oracle Essbase cubes where the Essbase server returns invalid metadata values would cause Tableau Desktop to unexpectedly exit. This has been corrected and Tableau now ignores the invalid metadata.

Map labels for Edo State in Nigeria were mislabeled as Ekpomo. This issue has been corrected.

Custom Value filter searches now have similar results returned from search strings between Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. Prior to this change there were different behaviors with respect to the handling of wildcard characters. Both products now follow the behavior of: 1) Searching for color* returns strings that begin with "color"; 2) Searching for *color returns strings that end with "color"; 3) Searching for *color* returns strings with "color" appearing anywhere in the string; 4) Searching for color with no wildcards is treated as if it were *color*.

Tableau Server
Corrected an issue where memory allocation wasn't handled correctly, resulting in Tableau Server shutting down unexpectedly.

Workbooks published with more than 5,000 filters wouldn't display when viewed in a mobile browser. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a security issue related to URL redirection.

Corrected an issue on Tableau Mobile where views would sometimes not open, displaying the error "A server with the specified hostname could not be found."

Views would sometimes show an error with no error details. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server versions that had migrated from version 6.x to 7.0.3 or higher sometimes experienced problems importing users from a CSV file, assigning workbook permissions, and editing data connections. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau servers configured for high availability with replicated data engine components would leave behind large temporary files after the replication process. These files sometimes consumed large amounts of disk space. Temporary files are now properly cleaned up after a sync.


Version 7.0.11 released December 20, 2012.
This release is an update to address two critical issues that affect both Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server versions 7.0.9 and 7.0.10. Tableau 7.0.11 is the same product as 7.0.10 with the following two issues corrected. There are no other changes in this release.

Extracts that had previously successfully refreshed would fail to refresh after upgrading to 7.0.9 or 7.0.10. Loading a view that used these extracts would result in a a file not found error. Log files showed the error, "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process." This issue affects both Desktop and Server.

Tableau iPad Application could not open workbooks from non-default sites. This issue has been corrected. The application is available on the Apple App Store.

Tableau 7.0.11 is the same product as 7.0.10 with the above issues corrected. There are no other changes in this release.


Version 7.0.10 released December 4, 2012.
New Capabilities
Added the -t, --tempdir [path] option for the tabadmin backup command. This option allows you to specify the directory used for temp files created during the backup.

Options were added to the tabcmd export command to specify the width and height of the page. Use 'tabcmd help export' to see the syntax for the new options.

Added support for Progress OpenEdge 11.1.

Added Support for Vectorwise 2.5.

Added support for Hortonworks.

Added support for DataStax.

Added support for Cloudera Impala (beta).

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Views would incorrectly become invalid (grayed out) when both a set and a field contained within that set were added to the same shelf. This issue has been corrected and in most cases adding both the set and the field result in a valid view.

For non-Asian languages, the calculations dialog box now uses the Courier New font in order to provide the best balance of readability.

Implemented a performance optimization when using large grouped fields while connected to Vertica databases, version 5.1 and later.

Corrected an issue where reference lines for totals would not appear in views with two continuous axes when one axis was a continuous date.

When connecting to Oracle databases, Tableau now correctly returns private synonyms as items that can be included in a connection.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when working with complex dashboards.

When connected to Oracle databases, using the DATENAME function to retrieve day names now uses the Oracle FMDay function instead of the Oracle Day function. The Oracle Day function would add trailing spaces to the returned names (e.g., "Monday" would be returned as "Monday ") because the function returned strings at the precise length of the longest word. Using these results would cause Tableau comparisons to fail. The DATENAME function now works as expected and returns just the day name without the trailing spaces.

When using Teradata Query Bands and editing the connection to delete a previously defined query band statement, the delete would not always succeed and the statement was not actually removed from the connection. This issue has been corrected and a deleted query band statement stays deleted.

When connected to a DB2 database, version 9.7 or later, using datetime fields defined as TIMESTAMP_ISO data types would cause the DB2 error 'SQL0583N The use of routine "SYSFUN.TIMESTAMP_ISO" is invalid because it is not deterministic or has an external action.' This issue has been corrected.

Implemented several changes to allow connecting to 1010data databases using an ODBC connection. This connection requires the use of a Tableau data source customization (.tdc) file, which the 1010data technical team can assist with.

Connections to OData data sources that include Top N limits where the N is a number evenly divisible by 100 would fail (i.e. 100, 200, 300 would fail while 99 or 101 would succeed). This issue has been corrected.

Using ODBC to connect to multiple tables in a SAS data source could cause the error 'Driver does not support this function.' This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Setting both page size and page orientation when exporting PDF files was not scaling the output properly. This issue has been corrected.

Wildcard searches on the Data Connections page, which are those that include an * in the search string, could result in search errors such as 'An error occurred while searching' and 'Ill-formed regular expression'. This issue has been corrected.

Date formats on Range of Date quick filters were not being correctly retained when a workbook was published to Tableau Server. This has been corrected and Server will now retain Desktop formatting.

Corrected an issue where exporting views as PDF, PNG, or CSV could cause the error 'Tableau Server encountered an internal error. Request ID: ... could not obtain a database connection within 10 seconds. The max pool size is currently 10; consider increasing it.'

Views on a dashboard that had page shelves set to synchronize were calculating which page to show based on the page number in the view, rather than on the value of the page shelf data. This issue has been corrected so that the page shown is based on the synchronized value.

The administrative view, Most Accessed Views, was only accounting for views in the Default site. It now correctly accounts for views in all sites.

Implemented a performance optimization when working with Extracts and the Data Server. This optimization caches metadata that workbooks retrieve from the extract. In some scenarios, caching this metadata provides a substantial performance improvement.

Cookies returned from Tableau Server when using trusted tickets were incorrectly using a 24-hour time representation, using 1-24 when 0-23 is the correct representation. The use of 24 (the midnight hour) was causing problems for some .NET applications.

Using the tabadmin stop command would generate an incorrect error "ERROR:Could not shutdown 'Tableau Server Repository' using a command line" in the Windows event log. Changes were implemented to prevent the incorrect error from being logged.

Corrected an issue in the Tableau Android application that could prevent it from connecting to Tableau Server.

The "Remember me" check box on the server login page sometimes had no effect. This issue has been corrected.



Version 7.0.9 released October 25, 2012.
New Capabilities
Tableau is now available in Korean and Simplified Chinese. In Desktop, select Help > Choose Language to change to the Korean or Chinese display. On Server, click your username at the top of the page and select a new language on the Language drop-down menu.

Added support for connecting to SAP Hana databases.

Tableau now supports connections to Cloudera CDH3u4 and CDH4.

Added support for connecting to Cloudera Hadoop Hive data sources using either Beeswax server only to increase concurrency or Beeswax server and Kerberos to increase concurrency and security. These options are now available during connection when using the Cloudera CDH3u4 driver and may require additional configuration of your cluster.

Added support for United States Congressional Districts to the built-in geocoding. You can now map this type of information by selecting the Congressional District geographic role. U.S. Congressional District boundaries are determined by data provided by each state's redistricting commission.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Optimized queries to Microsoft SQL Server tables where columns defined as INT data types were sometimes queried in a way that was missing the index.

When connecting to SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW) data sources, using the Wildcard quick filter mode could sometimes cause an "Invalid MDX command" database error. This issue has been corrected and these filters no longer cause an error.

When connecting to a Teradata database, joining two tables that have same name that differ only by case could cause a "Command text was not set for the command object" error. Tableau was not accounting for the case sensitivity correctly. This issue has been corrected and Tableau now correctly handles the table names and creates the join.

When adding support for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese characters in the calculated field dialog box, the default font was changed. However, the new font did not properly support all of the characters across these languages. This dialog box now selects a font based on the Workbook Language. For example, if the workbook language is set to Korean, then all Korean characters are supported. However, Chinese characters may not display correctly until the workbook language is changed to Chinese.

Increased the default "rows to fetch" size for Greenplum connections from 100 to 10,000. This change can improve query performance by minimizing the number of distinct calls needed to return a large number of records.

When using the Measure Names field to color marks based on two instances of the same measure, the default color encoding was saved regardless of changes to the color legend. Saving and reopening the workbook would revert to the default colors. This issue has been corrected.

Changing the sort order of the members of a set manually would not always save correctly if the members contained special characters (e.g., parenthesis). This issue has been corrected and the special characters are now being handled so the sort order is retained.

A "Large Publish Warning" message would sometimes occur when publishing a workbook with a live connection to a large external file. The warning would display even when the "Include External Files" check box was cleared. This issue no longer occurs and these workbooks are published without warning.

In previous versions, it could sometimes take a long time to enumerate schemas for Oracle connections. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem in Version 7.0.8 in which the Calculated Fields dialog box font was smaller than in earlier versions.

Tableau Server
Previously, when a data source field name contained a backslash (\) character, Tableau Server rejected requests to update filters that depended on the field. An error message would display saying that the server could not respond due to a malformed request. This issue has been corrected.

Embedding and then resizing a fixed size view in Internet Explorer version 8.0 sometimes resulted in a blank page being loaded instead of the view. This issue has been corrected.

Workbooks based on MSAS data sources would sometimes fail to load and an "Analysis Services database error" would display. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem in which the tabcmd syncgroup command would not always correctly import or remove users from Tableau Server.

Previously, sizing a dashboard to an extremely small height using Internet Explorer version 8.0 on Windows 7 or Windows XP would cause the web browser to become unresponsive. This issue no longer occurs.

Using the "Download all rows as a text file" option to export data in a CSV file sometimes had an encoding problem and all fields were exported as one column. This encoding issue has been corrected.

Incremental extract refreshes would fail if they followed a purge of backgrounder tasks. This was because the purge removed a directory necessary for the extract refreshes to complete. This issue has been corrected.

PDF files generated from tabcmd export are now sized correctly.

Tableau Server usernames and passwords could not be updated with the tabcmd createusers or createsiteusers commands, even though the output indicated that the update occurred. This issue has been corrected.

Filters added via the URL were sometimes not applied. This issue has been corrected.



Version 7.0.8 released September 20, 2012.
New Capabilities
Spanish and Portuguese maps are now available. These maps will display according to your workbook language setting (Help > Choose Language). You may need to clear the map tile cache in order for the new maps to display. You can clear the cache by opening Internet Explorer and deleting your browse history in the Internet Options.
Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Tableau's handling of large binary data over ODBC connections sometimes resulted in "Out of memory" errors. Improvements were made to memory usage for this type of data.

Corrected how fractional seconds in columns defined as datetime datatypes were handled for ODBC connections. Tableau was handling fractional seconds as a fractional value rather than matching the ODBC specification and treating the fractional seconds as billionths of a second. Treating the data as a fractional value could lead to dates being reported incorrectly when fractional times were used. In conjunction with this change, the CAP_ODBC_FETCH_IGNORE_FRACTIONAL_SECONDS customization option was added, which will instruct Tableau to discard fractional seconds for ODBC sources that don't correctly handled the fractions as billionths of a second. Refer to Customizing and Tuning ODBC Connections to learn more.

Disabled the option to change a background image defined in a data source that was created by "Creating a Local Copy" of a Tableau Server data source. Background images in this scenario were meant to be part of the definition inherited from the Server.

Connecting to SAS using an ODBC connection could cause a "Driver does not support this function error." In this case, the error was related to the driver not support foreign key detection.

Creating an extract from an extract data source that was published to Tableau Server, could cause the error "No details available." This error occurred when the Tableau Server data source contained an aggregate calculation. This issue has been corrected.

Commas were difficult to distinguish when writing formulas in the Calculated Field dialog box. When Japanese support was added, the font used in this dialog box was changed to support Japanese characters. The font is now dependent on the workbook language.

Tableau Server
The view data page now displays in the correct language based on the language preference you set on your Tableau Server account page rather than always using the browser language.

Connections to Tableau Server data sources (i.e., data sources that are published to the data server) now optimize queries by selecting which tables to include in the FROM clause. This optimization is often referred to as join culling and excludes tables that will not impact the results returned. This change can often make queries run significantly faster. This optimization only affects connections to data sources that are published to Tableau Server.

Optimized performance for the tabadmin start command when the server uses a core license or when high availability is configured.

Using tabcmd to publish workbooks with hidden sheets would publish all the sheets including the hidden ones. This issue has been corrected.

On dashboards, action filters set to "Exclude all values" for the target sheet was not working correctly. This issue has been corrected.

Combining both the --publisher and --license options when using tabcmd syncgroup or tabcmd addusers commands would not set the publisher role. Instead, you would have to run two separate commands. This issue has been corrected and you can now use both options on a single command.

Workbooks and data sources sometimes failed to download if Tableau Server was installed using a lower case drive letter. This issue has been corrected.

Relative date filters displayed on a view with a dark background now correctly shows the relative date selection as black text on a white background. Previously, the filter would show as white text on a white background and would not be readable.

Corrected an issue where unexpected values would be selected after searching in a quick filter.

Fixed a problem with URL actions not performing correctly in Internet Explorer v8.0.

Loading a view sometimes resulted in the following error message "Unknown SessionID class std::out_of_range". This issue has been corrected.

A background process would sometimes fail in high availability clusters and the following message would display: "Name has already been taken." This issue has been corrected.




Version 7.0.7 released August 7, 2012.
New Capabilities
Tableau is now available in Japanese. In Desktop, select Help > Choose Language to change to the Japanese display. On Server, click your username at the top of the page and select Japanese in the Language drop-down menu.

Added support for connecting to Microsoft PowerPivot 2012.

Added support for connecting to MapR Hadoop distributions.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
When connected to a MySQL database, creating a group from a calculated field would result in empty values until the data was extracted. This issue has been corrected and these groups now display the correct values with a live connection to the database.

The built-in geocoding now recognizes "Ft" as a synonym for "Fort" to match places such as "Ft Lauderdale" and "Ft Worth."

Corrected how the built-in geocoding represents the Moscow region and urban area.

Adjusted how double-clicking zooms on maps to correct occasional inconsistencies.

When connected to a multidimensional data source, the Edit Locations dialog box would show the full field name instead of the values (e.g., "[customer].[state]" instead of "British Columbia"). This issue has been corrected.

Saving and reopening a workbook that has reference lines based on parameters would reset the reference line to use the axis field instead. This issue has been corrected.

Refreshing all extracts in a workbook would fail if some of the data sources required a username and password. Tableau now prompts for the necessary authentication before refreshing these extracts.

Improved performance when working with date fields in a DB2 database. DATE fields are no longer wrapped with the TIMESTAMP_ISO function. This change does not affect DATETIME fields.

The application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when removing a field from the Size shelf after hiding the size legend. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where using a reference line based on a parameter could cause a "Schema:GetIndex" error.

Corrected an issue where attempting to print from Tableau could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

When connecting to Oracle databases, corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit if the account logging into Oracle does not have access to the Oracle V$VERSION Oracle system object. Tableau uses the V$VERSION system object to determine the Oracle version number. Without access to this object, the application cannot connect. In these cases, the application now displays an error message instead of exiting.

Inserting the "Data Update Time" into a title or caption would show the UTC time when connected to an extract data source. This issue has been corrected and the local time is now shown.

When connected to an Excel workbook, the application could sometimes unexpectedly exit when modifying the Fiscal Year Start for a date dimension. This issue has been corrected.

The application could unexpectedly exit when connecting to an OData data source that has a field with a one-to-many relationship. The application no longer exits in this case.

When connected to an SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW) database, quick filters for measures did not always display correctly. This issue has been corrected.

When connected to a Tableau Server data source, adding a context filter could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Optimized indexing for temporary tables that the application generates when filtering dimensions. Ensuring that these tables are indexed improves performance.

When performing scheduled extract refreshes using workbooks that include Initial SQL, the scheduled tasks were not correctly identified as failed if the initial SQL failed. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
The tabcmd export command was not properly creating output files (PDF or CSV) when filter or parameter values were specified. This issue has been corrected.

If you have unlicensed machines running VizQL servers in the cluster, you could get the error, 'Fatal Exception in vizql engine.' The unlicensed state is now detected as the cause and a, 'No license found; Session creation failed' message is returned instead.

In a distributed environment, downloading workbooks from a site that is not the default would cause intermittent download errors. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected some problems with syncing non-Latin usernames (including Hebrew and Czech) from Active Directory.

Opening views using Mobile Safari would not always scale the view to the full width of the iPad, leaving a gap on the right side of the page. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where invalid date values in a CSV file (e.g., a date with a year value that is 7 digits long) would cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

When embedding views the _http_requests audit table was not setting the user_id value. This issue has been corrected and the username is now properly set in the _http_requests table for embedded views.

Using the Data Connections page to update the connection properties for multiple connections in a single workbook could result in the error, 'Attempted to update a stale object: Workbook.' This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where navigating to the Site page to add a user would show an empty page.

Filtering the list of views or workbooks by date would result in no workbooks showing if the server was installed in a timezone east of GMT. This issue has been corrected.

Using tabcmd to export PDF files would fail if automatic login was enabled on the server. This issue has been corrected.

When using filter actions in dashboards actions could stop functioning if the workbook was configured to show sheets as tabs and it was published to a non-default site. This issue has been corrected.

Optimized performance for adding users using the 'tabcmd addusers' command.

Corrected an issue where Active Directory groups that have zero members that were imported into a version 6.1 server would prevent that server from successfully upgrading to 7.0.

Names in Hebrew were not properly displayed in the /users page on Tableau Server. This issue has been corrected.

The server was not correctly prompting for a password when viewing a workbook that connects to IBM DB2 databases using the ODBC (generic) connection type. Instead it was displaying a security processing error. This case is now handled properly and a more relevant error message is provided when incorrect credentials are provided.

Additional Considerations
When using Tableau Desktop or Server in Japanese, the built-in maps will display in English. To use the Japanese maps, download the Online.tms file shown below and copy it into the directory where you installed Tableau (see examples below). This extra step will NOT be necessary in future versions of Tableau.




Version 7.0.6 released July 2, 2012.
New Capabilities
Tableau for Android is now available. The Tableau application is available in the Google Play Store. Tableau Server also supports the Android web browser.

Added support for ParAccel 3.5 and later.

Added support for DATETRUNC, DATEPART, DATEPART, DATEADD, and DATEDIFF functions when connecting to ParAccel 3.5 or later.

Added a Repeat Map option to the Map Options card. When this option is selected, the map and corresponding marks will be repeated in the far East and West of the map area. The Repeat Map opiton is off by default.

Added functionality so that wgserver session IDs appear for some Tableau Server events in the Windows Event logs, thus allowing administrators to correlate Tableau Server Event log entries with data in the Server Activity administrative view. To see the data, from a tooltip in the Server Activity view, click View Data, then select the Underlying tab. Scroll to the right to see the session_id column.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Print to PDF options (e.g., paper size and orientation) were not saved each time a PDF was generated. This issue has been corrected and the settings are now saved.

Added Kosovo state names to built-in geocoding.

Improved performance when connecting to ParAccel 3.5 and later by no longer creating temporary tables. Nested select statements are used instead.

Filter actions that are set up to run on menu now also create a selection before running the action. This change allows these actions to be run from the tooltip and cleared by clearing the selection.

Optimized performance for Oracle database queries that have filters that use numeric data types.

The application would sometimes become briefly unresponsive before running a custom value list or wildcard match quick filter. This issue has been corrected.

The application now caches information about whether a field is valid, which can improve performance in very slow workbooks.

Labels were getting culled too aggressively. This issue has been corrected and labels behave as they did in earlier versions.

When connected to CSV files, aggregating a measure as a Standard Deviation (STDEV) would return different results depending on whether connecting to the live data source or an extract. This issue has been corrected.

The application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when filtering on null values. This issue has been corrected.

The application would unexpectedly exit when formatting a view in a dashboard using the Format window. This issue has been corrected.

During extract refreshes the following message would sometimes display: "Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: Cannot create a file when that file already exists." This problem has been fixed.

Some boolean calculated fields that referenced secondary data sources would return inconsistent results when used in different workbooks. These workbooks are corrected by saving the workbook using version 7.0.6 and reopening them.

Replacing a data source with a Tableau Server data source could fail with a "no such column" error. This error was caused when a workbook contained context filters and calculated fields that were materialized in the data server. This issue has been corrected and replacing a data source in these cases no longer causes an error.

While viewing a dashboard, running an action from the tooltip without first making a selection could cause a "Commit called on nested editor" error. This issue has been corrected and the action no longer causes an error.

The quick sort options were incorrectly available in the toolbar when table calculation headers were selected. These fields can be manually sorted but computed sorts are now correctly disabled.

Improved performance for changing global quick filters that apply to several extract data sources.

Manually sorting a table calculation field was no longer available. This feature has been restored and you can now sort these fields as expected.

Table calculation fields that were on the filter shelf and used elsewhere in the view, would be invalid in version 7.0.5 because of how the application was determining the fields available for addressing. This issue has been corrected and these fields are no longer invalid.

Tableau Server
Corrected an issue where filters that functioned in Tableau Desktop sometimes didn't function after the workbook was published to Tableau Server when "Show Sheets as Tabs" was cleared.

Optimizations were made in the number of seconds it takes to load a view.

Addressed a security issue related to cookies.

There were problems using the tabcmd GET command to get groups.xml. Not every group was included. This issue has been corrected.

Using the "View underlying data" option on the tooltip sometimes resulted in an "out of memory" error when the data set was extremely large. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem with exporting a view as a PDF using the Unspecified paper size.

Due to issues with the JRE that shipped with version 7.0.2, migrating to version 7.0.2 from an earlier version sometimes resulted in a "tabmigrate.bat" error. This issue has been corrected.

Issues related to working with very large Active Directory groups have been corrected, including importing and synchronizing.

Previously, a blue line sometimes appeared on dashboards set to an exact size (instead of 'Automatic'). This issue has been corrected.

In certain circumstances, Tableau Server would not release unneeded system resources, thus causing "out of memory" errors. This issue no longer occurs.

Published workbooks viewed with an iPad sometimes displayed encoding when a date was entered into a date parameter. This issue has been corrected.

Active Directory groups whose name included special characters (such as the umlaut) sometimes didn't import correctly. This issue has been corrected.

The "Show Fewer Values" quick filter displays only values for which you have data. There was an issue when this filter was enabled and there were >200 values. The index that was operated on for selections was that of "Show More Values" not "Show Fewer Values". This issue has been corrected.

The tooltip for the reap extracts server task (in Administrative Views) now displays the number of bytes that are successfully deleted. It also displays the number of bytes that cannot be deleted--for example, because they are being held by active sessions.

Corrected an issue that sometimes made "date-only" parameters display time.

After setting a new customized view as the Default then republishing the view, the Default view was sometimes lost. This issue has been corrected.

A published dashboard that had been set to a range of sizes then exported to PDF would resize to the smallest setting and not return to other sizes until the user either logged out or clicked the Revert All button. This issue has been corrected.

Synchronizing Active Directory groups sometimes resulted in users being removed from the groups incorrectly. Groups are now synchronized correctly.

The tabcmd syncgroup command would fail to license users the first time it was run, but it would succeed the second time. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected inconsistencies in how Tableau Server handled UTF-8 and UTF-16 files, including CSV files which are used to import users. Also added support for ISO-8859-2, which is part of the ISO 8859 series of ASCII-based character encodings.

Tableau Server sometimes erroneously displayed a â€œMultiple Tableau Server connections are not supportedâ€? message when opening a workbook that connected to a republished, packaged Tableau Server data source (.TDSX). This problem has been corrected.

Tableau Server failed to import certain Active Directory groups because their names contained special characters that Tableau Server didn't recognize. This issue has been corrected.

Previously, the vizql server process would sometimes hang after stopping and starting the server. This issue has been addressed and the process now executed correctly.

After restarting Tableau Server, the wgserver process sometimes failed to stop and start. This issue has been corrected.



Version 7.0.5 released June 3, 2012.
This release is an emergency update to address a performance issue in version 7.0.4. The issue was related to calculated fields where generating axis encodings while rendering views was substantially slower than in previous versions. Loading views in both Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server was noticeably slower. Version 7.0.5 contains a correction for just this issue.

Tableau 7.0.5 is the same product as 7.0.4 with the above issue corrected. There are no other changes in this release.



Version 7.0.4 released May 24, 2012.
New Capabilities
Tableau supports two additional languages with this release: Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian).

Added support for connecting to SAP® Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW). To connect Tableau to SAP BW, you must have the SAP GUI for windows version 7.20 or later and SAP BW version 7.0 or later. It's recommended that you install at least SAP 7.0 SP20+ to leverage important fixes. Learn more about connecting to SAP BW in the Connecting to SAP BW article.

This version of Tableau Server includes failover support and the ability to configure a highly available gateway, two features designed to minimize your server system's potential for downtime. For details, refer to the Server Online Help.

The SQL Server 2012 driver (code name Denali v11.x) is now supported.

Several improvements were made to the Sites user interface and functionality. System administrators of multi-site server systems can now give content administrators the ability to add users to a site. Content administrators can do this via the UI or through the tabcmd command line utility.

This release brings new functionality to the content administrator role if the server is running multiple sites. System administrators can allow content administrators to add and remove server users, as well as set an upper limit for how many users can be added to a site.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when changing the aggregation of a continuous field on the Color shelf after specifying a specific Start or End value for the color ramp.

Corrected a case where window table calculations could be defined with a start value that was greater than the end value, thus creating an invalid window. In these cases, the formula would validate but cause an error message when trying to use the field in the view. These formulas can no longer be created.

Improved geocoding performance, which increases rendering speed for filled maps and other geocoding queries.

Updated the error message that displays in the calculated field dialog box when using the Modulo function with a non integer value.

When connected to Vectorwise databases, calculated field names were incorrectly case sensitive, which caused the queries to return empty values. This issue has been corrected.

In some cases, certain reference lines would be removed after closing and reopening the workbook. This issue has been corrected.

Filter actions that are set up to run on menu selection now also create a selection before running the action. This change allows these actions to be run from the tooltip and cleared by clearing the selection.

Connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database could cause the database error: "The text, ntext, and image data types cannot be compared or sorted, except when using IS NULL or LIKE operator." This error was caused when the remote column name did not match the local column name. This issue has been corrected.

When filtering on fields from a secondary data source, the ATTR aggregation was incorrectly shown as an option for quantitative fields. This issue has been corrected and it is now only available for categorical fields.

Added support for the ESPG:4283 geographic projection in WMS maps in order to support a large amount of Australian WMS data.

Tableau Desktop could sometimes unexpectedly crash during start up. This issue was caused by a licensing error that was not being handled correctly. This issue has been corrected.

Calculations would not always get materialized correctly when refreshing an optimized extract, which could lead to reduced performance. This issue has been corrected.

When connected to a Tableau Server data source, editing aliases is now disabled. Previously, you could edit the aliases locally but the changes would not be stored with the workbook.

Actions that run on a menu command were not available when selecting a dimension. This issue has been corrected and the actions are now available when right-clicking a dimension and in the dimension tooltip.

Tableau Desktop would sometimes unexpectedly exit when adding a linking field to the Level of Detail shelf. This issue was caused by an out of memory exception that is now detected.

When opening a workbook that connects to a Tableau Server data source, the error "no such function, prepare.xml, class DataSourceException" could occur. This error occurred when the data type for a column was customized before the data source was published. These columns are now being handled correctly and the error no longer occurs.

Tableau Desktop could unexpectedly exit after refreshing extracts that contained a calculated field that uses the DATETRUNC function. This issue has been corrected.

Actions and tooltips that referenced fields that had the greater than (>) and less than (<) symbols in the field names would not run because these characters were not escaped properly. This issue has been corrected.

Adding to an extract from a file was failing due to hidden sets that were created automatically by actions on dashboards. These hidden sets are no longer taken into account when adding to an extract from a file.

Workbooks that connect to extracts from Vertica databases and have calculated fields that use the SPACE() function, would cause a Data Engine error when opening. This error has been corrected and these workbooks now open correctly.

Creating a view with a custom date that used the M/D/Y format, could cause the error "Invalid field formula due to limitations in the data source." when the field is made continuous. This type of custom date can only be viewed as a discrete dimension and the application and Show Me! have been updated to enforce that.

Some Polish regions were not correctly filled when using filled maps. This issue has been corrected.

Using RAWSQL functions could sometimes cause an error when the calculated field is used in a TOP N filter. This error was due to a side query Tableau would run in order to optimize future queries. This issue has been corrected.

The application could unexpectedly exit when adjusting specific types of quick filters. This issue has been corrected.

Added an Initial SQL option for connections to IBM DB2 databases. This allows you to define commands that will be run at the initial connect time, which can be useful to set environment options. For example, you can run the SET ISOLATION LEVEL UR command upon connection to allow queries to execute against tables with uncommitted reads.

Opening specific workbooks that connect to Tableau Server data sources could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue was caused by a naming conflict in parameter names. This issue has been corrected and the conflicting parameters are now given unique names in the data source.

When editing a Teradata connection, the connection information (joins, custom SQL, etc.) was not retained. This issue has been corrected and the connection information is available after a connection is restored.

Specific dashboards created from ODBC connections would intermittently cause the application to exit. Tableau now detects this issue and handles it correctly. 

Added the ability to specify odbc-connect-string-extras via Tableau Data Connections (TDC). You can learn about TDC customization in the Customizing and Tuning ODCB Connections article.

Modified the Edit Locations dialog box to increase performance by only showing unknown locations that are missing from the view when dealing with a large domain. An option has been added to the dialog box to show all unknown locations in these cases.

When changing the aliases of a parameter on the color or size legend, the aliases would sometimes be overridden with original values. This issue has been corrected.

The logic used to determine which tables we include in the queries (our join culling) fro Oracle databases now properly account for Oracle synonyms. 

Publishing workbooks that contains custom geocoding would fail if the Include External Files option was not selected. The message has been modified to make this issue more clear.

If the target for an action is a dashboard that has a comma in the name, running the action would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

The rich text editor now recognizes shortcuts that use the Alt and Ctrl+Alt keys so you can type symbols like the euro symbol(â‚¬) using Ctrl+Alt+E.

The term "Yukon Territory" is now correctly recognized as a synonym of "Yukon" in the built-in geocoding.

The application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when working with large extracts. This issue was caused by an out of memory error. The error is now handled correctly and the application does not exit.

Tableau now recognizes fields named "Countries" when automatically identifying geographic fields. These columns are assigned the "Country" geographic role.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when computing quick filters.

The "Data Update Time" that can be inserted into titles and captions was not properly representing different locale settings. The time is now always expressed in the time zone of the computer that is opening the workbook. The format is determined by the workbook locale setting.

The application would exit with the following message when using certain calculated fields: "Tableau has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience." This issue has been corrected.

Editing aliases for Measure Names would cause the names to be duplicated in the Edit Aliases dialog box. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to Cloudera Hadoop Hive data sources, date functions were not properly taking daylight savings boundaries into account. This issue has been corrected.

When a table calculation was on the Filter shelf the dimensions on the Level of Detail shelf were not available for specifying the addressing for the calculation. This issue has been corrected.

Replacing a data source now correctly converts actions to use the new data source.

Certain worksheets would open slower in version 7.0 than in earlier versions. This issue has been corrected.

Some workbooks would cause intermittent runtime errors when modifying actions on dashboards. These errors have been corrected.

Modified map boundaries to clip at +/- 72 degrees latitude in panes that are much wider than they are tall. In these cases, the map is scaled to ensure all countries are shown. Before this change, the map would be scaled smaller than necessary because it included area all the way to each pole. Now the map can remain a little larger because it is clipped before getting all the way to the poles.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when changing the layout for specific dashboards.

Groups and manual sort orders were not always maintained correctly when connecting to SQL Server databases. This issue has been corrected.

Some dashboards would not update when changing parameter values because the columns were being improperly cached. This issue has been corrected.

Replacing a SQL Server data source with a Tableau Server data source would sometimes cause the application to exit. This issue has been corrected.

Optimized ParAccel connections to support multiple row inserts when adding metadata to temporary tables (used when filtering).

Corrected a case where the application would become unresponsive when opening a worksheet that had a very large number of tick marks on the axis.

When connected to a Tableau Server data source, the Data > Tables menu item was incorrectly available. Modifying the tables in a published data sources is not supported. This menu item is no longer available.

The terms "Newcastle upon Tyne" and "Kingston upon Hull" are now recognized as synonyms for "Newcastle" and "Kingston" respectively in the built-in geocoding.

Updated the Microsoft MSVC runtime DLLs to the latest 2010 SP1 versions to pick up security fixes from Microsoft.

When connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services databases, quick filters for a boolean table calculation would not update correctly. For example, clearing "False" would filter the data but the quick filter would still show a check mark next to "False." This issue has been corrected and the quick filter now correctly reflects the filter state.

Dual axis charts would attempt to align zeros even when the "Include Zero" option was not selected. This behavior has been changed to not align zeroes unless "Include Zero" is selected for both axes.

Progress OpenEdge connections were not handling bit/boolean (logical) fields properly when using Custom SQL. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where views would not update after changing to a new user in the user filter. The workbook now updates correctly.

When refreshing or removing an extract, which had previously been published to the data serve using embedded database credentials there were cases where it would not be able to complete the refresh of the extract. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a discrepancy in DATE_TRUNC functions results between a live Aster connection and working with an extract from an Aster database. The Aster database calculated dates with Monday as the first day of the week. Tableau uses Sunday as the first day. This difference is now accounted for when creating extracts from Aster.

Groups and manual sort orders were not always maintained correctly when connecting to SQL Server databases. This issue has been corrected.

Enabled a TDC customization for Oracle data sources, that allows you to set CAP_QUERY_SUBQUERY_QUERY_CONTEXT to avoid expensive queries involving temporary tables. You can learn about TDC customization in the Customizing and Tuning ODCB Connections article.

Support was added for the SQL Server 2012 driver.

Tableau Server
The Export Data permission has been renamed to View Underlying Data and cannot be enabled unless View Summary Data is also enabled. These two permissions allow a user to see and download data using the tooltip in Tableau Server.

Corrected an issue where certain server updates, such as adding new users, would sometimes not take effect.

The Online Help for the --site tabcmd option has been updated to reflect that the site's ID, not name, is required to use this option.

The version of JRuby used by Tableau Server has been upgraded to 1.6.7, which contains a security patch.

Addressed a problem where filter actions that were applied by hovering over a mark and clicking the filter link in the tooltip were not being cleared.

In earlier versions of Tableau Server, in order to assign a backgrounder server process to a machine you also had to assign it at least one application server process. This is no longer the case.

Corrected an issue that was causing workbooks connecting to a Teradata database to intermittently fail to load.

Increased security for communication to and from the Tableau Data Engine. Tableau Server's data engine will now only accept connections from machines in the cluster.

Fixed an issue where marks in dashboards sometimes appeared to shift slightly when they were highlighted with a mouse-over.

There was a problem with published workbooks with identical data connections. One data connection could be successfully edited, while the other could not. This problem has been fixed.

Selecting "revert all" on a dashboard and then exporting to PDF would create multiple copies of the dashboard in the PDF. This issue has been corrected.

Improvements were made to reduce "Out of memory" errors when adequate main memory exists. Specifically, the VizQL, wgserver, background, and data server processes now each use up to 4 GB of RAM per instance instead of 2 GB of RAM when they are installed on a 64-bit operating system. Also, old sessions are now released more quickly when a process is at risk of running out of memory.

The "Session ended by server" errors now have more informative messages.

Stopping a Tableau Server cluster via the tabadmin stop command sometimes took several minutes. This performance has been improved.

Views in the process of being loaded sometimes showed a completely blank page instead of the spinner that indicates that the load is underway. This issue has been fixed.

Instead of being prevented, certain invalid date formats were allowed. When the workbook was published, they would display as "NaN-NaN-NaN". Now, invalid date formats are prevented.

The tabcmd export command now has better, more informative error handling.

Workbooks with a slider control disabled in Tableau Desktop would have the same control enabled after publishing to Tableau Server. This issue has been fixed.

Resolved an issue where published workbooks with a date parameter slider didn't function correctly.

An issue was fixed in which a workbook with a live connection to Excel stopped reflecting changes to data when an extract was added and both were published with the "Include external files" check box cleared.

The "unsafe" backup tabadmin command allows you to create a database backup while Tableau Server is running. There was an error where this type of backup was failing. This issue has been fixed.

In previous versions, the Space Usage admin view did not show the correct size of workbooks or data sources with extracts. This has been corrected.

Scroll bars were sometimes included in exported PDFs. This issue has been fixed.

Better error handling was added for when embed code includes an invalid host URL.

After restoring a "no config" backup to a clean install of Tableau Server 7.0, adding a new admin user sometimes resulted in the following error: "missing attribute: admin_level". This problem has been fixed.

Addressed a problem in which fixed size dashboards would sometimes look correct in Tableau Desktop but not after they were published to Tableau Server.

A problem was fixed for workbooks that are published without tabs and that include filter actions that run on Select. Previously, when such a workbook was published, making a selection sometimes resulted in another browser window launching with a malformed URL. Note that if a view's filter action is created with no target field, making a selection results in nothing happening. This is by design.

A licensing error occurred when users published workbooks that connected to Tableau Server data sources. Specifically, the error occurred when the data source was created and published using dissimilar editions of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. For example, an OEM edition of Tableau Desktop and a non-OEM edition of Tableau Server. This issue has been corrected.

Addressed a problem where tooltips sometimes didn't display long enough for users to interact with them and make selections on the tooltip.

Previously, it was possible for an invalid (unlicensed) Tableau Server user to initiate an extract refresh using the tabcmd utility. This is now prevented.

A tabadmin setting (vizqlserver.trustedticket.log_level) was added to provide more data about trusted authentication requests and responses. The default setting is "info". For a more details, set it to "debug".

Views that prompted Tableau Server users for database credentials were not loading correctly if the Tableau Server Guest account was being used. This problem has been fixed.

Resolved a problem where date/range filters in Tableau Desktop were being published as date/time filters.

Views with reference lines now correctly retain the references lines when they are modified and saved as custom views.

Fixed an issue in which views embedded with the email Share option weren't always loading correcting.

Fixed an issue where custom views including groups could not be saved.

Logging during Setup was improved to better disclose any issues that prevent Tableau Server from installing, such as certain ports not being available.

You can create a workbook with a date field parameter that "steps forward" by an interval you specify, such as a certain number of days. When such a workbook was published, however, an incorrect interval was used. This issue has been resolved.

The tabcmd export command was enhanced to expose settings for Page Size and Page Orientation (defaults are Letter and Portrait, respectively). Learn more about these options in the Server Online Help.

A number of issues were fixed related to when Tableau Server is configured to use SSL and a reverse proxy server.

When Tableau Server was configured to use Active Directory for user authentication, user names that included diacritic characters (such as a "u" with an umlaut) did not display correctly. This issue has been fixed.

There were issues with displaying a scrolling view on an iPad in landscape orientation, including the x axis sometimes not being included. These issues have been corrected.

Because of an internal timestamp issue, embedded views using trusted tickets sometimes returned a 'Couldn't validate request' error after being clicked. This issue has been fixed.

A problem was fixed with the tabadmin ziplogs -d option. It now correctly allows you to only include logs since a certain date.

In earlier versions of Tableau Desktop it was possible to publish a workbook that relied on external files with the "Include External Files" check box cleared. Now a message appears to confirm that this is your intent.

For certain connections, you can create custom initial SQL statements. There was a problem where editing the connection on Tableau Server removed the initial SQL. This issue has been fixed.

Tableau Server's drop-down menus now work in Opera 11.62.

Loading a view sometimes resulted in an error message that read, "The system cannot find the file specified". This issue has been fixed.

Administrators logging into a non-default site sometimes saw a "Service down" red X appear next to certain services on the site's Maintenance page. This issue has been fixed.

Views would sometimes fail to load and the error message 'java.lang.NullPointerException' would be in the Windows Event Viewer and Tableau VizQL log files. This issue no longer occurs.

Previously, every time tabadmin was run a binary jffi*.tmp file was created in the TEMP directory and not removed after the command had been run. This problem has been fixed.

Fixed an issue where the "slider" for a range of dates disappeared after the view was published.

Fixed a problem with DateTime quick filters in which they would display correctly in Tableau Desktop but incorrectly after being published to Tableau Server.

Tableau Server data source connections sometimes failed for all users but the data source publisher. This issue no longer occurs.

The number of asynchronous wgserver background threads was increased to better handle Tableau database connection requests made via tabcmd get.

Corrected a problem in which Tableau was not correctly interpreting the DB2 "connection closed" message and was itself returning a "Session Ended by Server" error.

The modified dates for projects and views were sometimes incorrect after an upgrade to version 7.0.3. This issue has been fixed.

Previously, users from different domains who belonged to multiple sites were not able to log into Tableau Server. This is no longer the case.

Previously, setting then clearing a workbook as a favorite on iPad returned error code 406. This no longer occurs.

If you were logged into Tableau Server with a username that contained a space, it wasn't possible to load a custom view (infinite spinner). This problem has been fixed.

If you upgraded from version 7.0.x to 7.0.3 and were running multiple sites, you may not have been able to add or edit sites. This problem has been fixed.

Certain date formats in Tableau Desktop include text. Workbooks published using non-English locales were not properly escaping the text so that it displayed in the correct language when published. This issue has been fixed.

Opening a workbook from the Filter by Publisher page sometimes resulted in an internal error page displaying. This issue has been fixed.

A security issue was fixed in the data server logs.

Fixed a problem where weekdays would be correctly displayed in a quick filter in Tableau Desktop but not after publishing to Tableau Server.

Fixed an issue involving adding a worker to the Tableau Server configuration, in which the worker being added failed to initialize.

When modifying all data connections across multiple pages (clicking the select all button twice), an undefined method error could occur and the connections would not be updated. This issue has been corrected.

There was a problem with changing user account Start page settings, including Language and Locale, on sites other than the Default site. That problem has been fixed.

Previously, there were problems with restoring a .tsbak file to a Windows 2003 server. This is now fixed.

There were issues with Tableau Server data sources that were created from NetezzaSQL data sources. Connecting to the Tableau Server data source sometimes resulted in the error "Function 'TRUNC(INT4)' does not exist". This has been fixed.

Corrected a problem in which dashboards with URL filter actions weren't loading properly in Internet Explorer.

Previously, there were some issues with product keys sometimes appearing twice on the Licenses page. This has been fixed.

Corrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.

Fixed an issue where pausing "Automatic Updates" on a published view, changing quick filters, then resuming the updates resulted in a blank view.

The --administrator option is one of the options you can use with the tabcmd syncgroup command. In earlier versions it assigned the Administrator user right to a group of users. Now it also allows you to designate an Administrator type of system, content, or none.

Several security improvements were made, including better prevention of SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

Added a configuration option to disable auto-complete for the username field on the login page. The new setting is wgserver.no_user_autocomplete. To disable the auto-complete for username, set this value to true. The default is to have auto-complete for usernames. The command to disable this would be: tabconfig set wgserver.no_user_autocomplete true

Additional Considerations
Maps displayed in Spanish and Portuguese-Brazilian versions will show English text for all labels on the maps. The English text is temporary while we finish creating the updated maps with the translated labels. Once the translated maps are available they will automatically appear. The translated maps are anticipated to be ready later this summer.




Version 7.0.3 released April 2, 2012.
This release is an emergency update to address the following product issues in Tableau Server version 7.0.2. It does not affect Tableau Desktop.

In the 7.0.2 Tableau Server release, there were problems with dashboards not refreshing correctly after certain actions were performed. Some examples of these actions include drawing a zoom box, changing a quick filter, or doing a 'Keep Only' or 'Exclude.' The underlying issue that was causing these problems has been corrected.

Upgrading to Tableau Server 7.0.2 from earlier versions could fail with the error "unable to create unique index." This error was caused by a change in how multiple customized views are handled. This issue only affected Tableau Server and has been corrected.

Customized views were not migrated when upgrading to Tableau Server 7.0.2 from earlier versions. This issue has been corrected in version 7.0.3. Upgrading from 7.0.1 and earlier will migrate customized views correctly.

Tableau Server 7.0.3 is the same product as 7.0.2 with the above issues corrected. There are no other changes in this release. Tableau Desktop is not affected. Your existing 7.0.0, 7.0.1, and 7.0.2 Desktop products will continue to work with the 7.0.3 Server.



Version 7.0.2 released March 22, 2012.
New Capabilities
Added the ability to create multiple customized versions of a view that can be shared, or "advertised," to other users. You can customize views while browsing Tableau Server or while interacting with an embedded view.You can also embed a custom view.

Added support for connecting to Teradata 14.0.

Added support for connecting to Progress OpenEdge 11.0.

Added support for the 4.6.3 Aster nCluster ODBC driver. If that driver is installed it will be used to connect to Aster Ncluster databases version 4.6 and higher. Using this driver corrects a memory problem when performing large queries.

Added support for connecting to Vertica 5.1.

Sites information has been added to the Administrative Views section of the Maintenance page.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Updated city and state names in the built-in geocoding for several cities around the world.

Copying and pasting table calculation fields between workbooks now correctly includes the default table calculation information including the Compute using option.

Changing the aggregation for a mark label that has been manually positioned would move the label back to the default position. This issue has been corrected for most cases. The custom position is not maintained when the field that defines the mark labels is on multiple shelves with multiple aggregations.

The field drop-down menu when targeting select fields for a filter action, now distinguishes between discrete date parts and continuous date values.

When defining an advanced ordering for a table calculation, you can now select an "Automatic" option when specifying the sort order. The automatic option uses the default sort order of the fields.

Corrected a case where custom relationships on continuous date fields were not being maintained correctly. This issue would cause the view to appear differently when the workbook was closed and reopened.

Custom relationships for a blended data source were not included when duplicating the connection. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue when selecting to 'show missing values' could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.

The application would unexpectedly exit when creating a custom date from a DATETIME parameter. You can no longer create custom dates from parameters.

Having a large number of saved data sources would compress the Tableau Server data sources area on the Connect to Data page. The saved data sources area is now a fixed size and scroll bars display as necessary.

Importing custom geocoding was causing a database error on machine's where the repository path contained non-ANSI characters (e.g., diacritics). This issue has been corrected by creating a temporary directory during the import that has a "safe" path name and then converting back to the correct path name after the import completes.

In some cases, selecting a header and clicking the quick sort options in the toolbar would sort the fields differently than in earlier versions. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where some large groups could cause the application to unexpectedly exit with the error message, "An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host."

Corrected a number of areas in the reference lines dialog box that were not properly localized.

The Page card would display on the left side of the workbook regardless of whether it had been moved to the right side of the sheet in earlier versions of the application. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where turning on totals for some views involving sets would cause a "Couldn't find a key during dictionary lookup" error.

Corrected built-in geocoding locations for many zip codes throughout the United States.

Corrected a case where views would not update after changing to a new user in the user filter. The workbook now updates correctly.

Corrected an issue where a license expired message would display with a negative date on systems where the date format is set to "ddd MMM dd yyyy."

The application would sometimes get stuck when switching the background map source from the Online option to a WMS server.

Connecting to SQL Azure using the Microsoft SQL Server connection dialog box would cause an error when loading the list of database tables. This issue has been corrected. Due to limitations of SQL Azure, the OLE DB protocol cannot be used in the same way as SQL Server. Instead Tableau falls back to using a Native ODBC connection as needed. This change does not affect normal connections to SQL Server.

Corrected an issue where filtering or sorting on a dimension whose members contains umlaut characters would cause an "Illegal mix of collations" error.

Some line charts would not always draw the same as they had in earlier versions. Specifically, more lines than expected were included due to null values. This issue has been corrected and the line charts now match earlier versions.

Show Me! would sometimes remove fields unexpectedly when using it with a view that has multiple mark types (e.g., lines and bars) This issue has been corrected.

Modifying aliases for members of a set would cause an error and in some cases the application would exit. Aliasing members of a set should not be supported, and the option has been removed from the context menu.

In some line charts, the mark labels were displayed in the upper left corner of the view instead of along the line. This issue has been corrected and mark labels now display correctly.

The application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when replacing an Excel data source with another data source. This issue has been corrected.

The Create Hierarchy option for relational data sources would only display in the context menu when another hierarchy already existed. This issue has been corrected and the Create Hierarchy option is now available when right clicking dimensions in the Data window.

Corrected an issue where Tableau could unexpectedly exit when selecting to logon to Tableau Server.

Tableau would sometimes use an underscore character (_) at the beginning of table names, which would cause problems when connecting to generic ODBC data sources. This issue has been corrected and table names always begin with an alpha character.

The manual sort option was not available when setting the default sort order for a set. This functionality was available in earlier versions but was removed with version 7.0. The manual sort option has been restored.

When publishing a workbook to Tableau Server, the default authentication method for Tableau Server data sources has been changed from "Prompt user" to "Embedded." Other data sources continue to default to "Prompt user."

Replacing a data source that contains a server defined group with another data source could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Updated the error message that displays in the calculated field dialog box when using the Modulo function with a non integer value.

When exporting data to Microsoft Access, the resulting table would sort the columns alphabetically based on their underlying column names instead of the aliases in Tableau. These columns are now sorted based on their Tableau aliases during export.

Tableau Server
Improvements were made to how quickly Tableau Server responds after a published view is clicked (or tapped).

Various improvements were made to memory usage.

It now takes less time to launch the server Configuration dialog box ('tabadmin config').

There was a problem with installing Tableau Server on a Simplified Chinese Windows 2008 operating system or a Turkish operating system. This issue has been corrected.

Groups in published data sources were not always being correctly refreshed when the data source was changed and republished. This issue has been corrected.

Extended characters in the Comments field sometimes resulted in the comment text being truncated. This issue has been corrected.

The default number of minutes of idle time after which a VizQL session is discarded has been changed from 120 to 30 minutes. Closing these sessions more frequently releases memory on the server, thus improving server performance. To change the default value of 30 minutes, you can use the tabadmin vizqlserver.session.expiry.timeout setting.

An error message reading "console is undefined" would sometimes display after an embedded view was loaded in an HTML page. This issue has been corrected.

When migrating from a v6 to v7 server, corrected a problem which would cause the error 'javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException: Unable to find com.tableausoftware.model.workgroup.Workbook with id '.

Reconfiguring the number of backgrounder processes sometimes had no effect. This issue has been corrected.

If a version 6.x server had a customized setting for the java.heap.size (when a version 6.x admin had run a command such as: tabadmin set java.heap size 1024m) then migrating to version 7.0 could fail with the error "Unable to upgrade <path>/tabsvc.yml to latest version". This issue has been corrected. The java.heap.size setting no longer impacts the server due to architectural changes to the repository.

There was an issue with restoring a version 6.1 backup to a version 7.0 server if, in the version 6.1 environment, there was no Default project or All Users group. This issue has been corrected.

Highlighting some of a view's data and clicking "Download all rows as a text file" sometimes resulted in not all of the data downloading. This problem has been fixed.

Starting with version 7.0, several server processes were re-engineered to be multi- instead of single-threaded. Because they are now more powerful than in previous releases, eight is the maximum number of processes you can run. You can configure this via the Servers tab in the Configuration utility. To change the upper limit from eight to another number, use the service.max_procs tabadmin setting. For more information, see the Tableau Server Online Help.

Pasting a list of items from the clipboard into a filter defined as a custom value list on Tableau Server would not always succeed. Specifically, the problem occurred if the data came from a source that used multiple formats for the data, such as Excel. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem where workbooks connecting to the Data Server to pass queries through to a database could cause a "500 Internal Server Error" when using the tabcmd utility to retrieve a PDF or PNG of the file.

Exported CSV data from Tableau Server ignored the 'List separator' value specified in the Windows locale settings. This issue has been corrected.

Re-importing a user from Active Directory with their name capitalized differently didn't work. This issue has been corrected.

The server cache setting "Refresh More Often" was not working. This issue has been fixed.

Running Tableau Server on a port other than 80 would cause some temp files after refreshing extracts to not be properly cleaned up, which could consume large amounts of disk space. This issue has been corrected.

In some cases, Tableau Server failed to install and the tabadmin.log showed that there were permissions issues (for example, "Unable to init component Components::Database"). This problem has been resolved.

When a hidden field has the same name as a URL parameter, the URL specified filter should be applied to the parameter. There was a problem in which the filter was being applied to the hidden field instead. This issue has been corrected.

Some customers upgrading from 7.0 to 7.0.1 experienced broken filter and view titles and missing image icons after the upgrade. This problem has been fixed.

You can designate a worker server to run the data engine. There was an issue where, if your first configuration attempt failed, any time you added an additional worker, the server would try to move the data engine to it. This has been corrected and a failed move will no longer result in an automatic retry.

Optimizations were made to where the extract refresh process is handled. In some cases, the result will be faster data extract refreshes.

An internal error sometimes occurred when using the export tabcmd to export a view as a pdf from a non-default site. This problem has been fixed.

A problem was corrected with the server "reap extracts" task which could potentially cause temp files to accumulate on the server.

Corrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.

Quick filter titles now load correctly in Google Chrome version 16.0.912.77.

Data connections using ODBC were not correctly embedding passwords. This issue has been fixed.

Tableau Server now correctly sets its cookies with the secure flag in a proxy server environment in which the proxy is configured for SSL but Tableau Server is not.

In situations where multiple groups were in the Groups page of Tableau Server, all members of each group were displayed, and not in alphabetical order. Now, lists of 10-15 members display in alphabetical order and a "More..." link lets you see additional group members.


Version 7.0.1 released February 21, 2012.
New Capabilities
Added support for connecting to Sybase IQ 15.3.

Added support for connecting to ParAccel 3.1.

Added Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) to filled maps for the United States.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
When publishing a workbook with multiple connections, opening the Authentication dialog to specify authentication options now allows you to select multiple connections (hold the CTRL-key on your keyboard) to change the settings for multiple connections at once.

Corrected how continuous date fields are labeled to correctly account for fiscal years that do not start in January.

Modified the Tableau Server Data Connection dialog box to make it easier to edit connections to published data sources.

A published data source that included a hierarchy could not be edited and republished to remove the hierarchy. This issue has been fixed.

Editing a parameter-based percentile reference line resulted in the application exiting. This issue has been fixed.

A workbook with more than 100 parameters would start to show duplicate parameter names at the bottom of the Analysis > Parameters menu. This issue has been fixed.

Data labels were not displaying in horizontal continuous area charts. These labels now display correctly.

Connecting to a Hadoop Hive data source via the Tableau Data Server would fail to create extracts with the error "Incorrect data type." This issue has been fixed.

Opening workbooks from earlier versions would not properly display field substitution values in the titles and captions. These values are now displayed as expected.

The Portuguese cities of Beja and Guarda have been added to our city geocoding data.

Custom relationships between data sources were not properly updated after replacing a data source. These relationships are now updated correctly.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit while editing a distribution reference line that used a parameter.

When working with multiple data sources with custom relationships between them, editing a relationship to remove all fields(leaving an undefined relationship) would save the empty state of the relationship when the workbook was saved. This issue has been fixed.

Tableau could unexpectedly exit when modifying the color of a gradient color legend. This issue has been fixed.

Corrected an issue with editing the color palette for a discrete calculated dimension that's been converted to continuous.

Right-clicking in an axis when using measure values and cube data sources could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.

Using filled maps and fields with table calculations could cause the error "The query results are missing a tuple required for computing totals." This issue has been fixed.

You can no longer add a new dimension to an existing hierarchy when the hierarchy was pre-defined in a TDS on Tableau Server. Hierarchies in this scenario should be read-only and attempting to modify them would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.

Incremental extract refreshes could cause calculated fields to become unusable after the second incremental refresh. This issue has been fixed.

Creating a highlight action without selecting the specific fields to highlight could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. Tableau now prompts you to select fields to target.

The link to the Online Help from the Teradata Connection Advanced Settings dialog was incorrect. This has been fixed.

Opening workbooks connecting to Oracle databases where filters or sets have become invalid due to changes on the database could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.

Corrected some cases where logarithmic axis labeling would show fewer tick mark labels than expected.

Corrected the placement of zip code 49931.

Optimized performance when opening workbooks with large extracts and a large number of unique dimension values in the worksheet. One example is a workbook with a 60 million row extract and over 2 million unique values in a field on the row shelf. This workbook originally took over 10 minutes to open and now takes about 2 minutes.

Changing the data type of a field from Date to String would cause the quick filter for that field to disappear after saving and reopening the workbook.

On the Start page, thumbnail images for workbooks opened from an SSL-enabled server now properly include the https part of the URL.

While creating an extract, if the connection between Tableau and the database server is interrupted, Tableau Desktop could unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.

When refreshing an extract that includes a calculated string field that uses a string field from a secondary , the connection to the secondary data source would not prompt to log in and would then fail. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem creating an extract from MySQL columns defined as a Time() datatype.

In rare cases, opening a packaged workbook (twbx) file would fail with the error "Unspecified error." The underlying problem was the packaged file contained an embedded image that was created without a modified date property. This issue has been corrected.

After selecting File > Print to PDF, immediately cancelling could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue with multi-table connections using ODBC connections when the source database does not support the SQL TOP clause.

Tableau Server
Support was added for the non-standard LDAP port for the Global Catalog. See http://kb.tableausoftware.com/articles/knowledgebase/configuring-tableau-server-for-global-catalog for details.

The number displayed for "All Users" was sometimes incorrect. This issue has been fixed.

The Administrative view "Space Usage" was updated to include data about data sources as well as workbooks.

There was a problem involving deleting Tableau Server users who no longer existed in Active Directory. This issue has been fixed.

Changing a quick filter that had values with non-English characters (such as Danish or Swedish characters) sometimes resulted in the error "Unexpected Server Error: Could not obtain from session sheet: ." This problem has been fixed.

Tableau updated the PostgreSQL database from version 9.0.4 to 9.0.5.

A problem was fixed with the layout of exported/printed workbooks.

A problem was fixed related to the tabcmd export --fullpdf command.

A problem was fixed where Tableau Server Setup wouldn't complete and the error "Invalid identifier" was displayed.

The setting Enable Guest allows users to see embedded views without having to log in to Tableau Server. This setting wasn't being properly invoked when, with Enable Guest selected, a user without access to a site was prompted for credentials when attempting to access one of the site's embedded views. This issue has been fixed.

There was an issue with adding users whose usernames exceeded 20 characters. This issue has been fixed.

Corrected display problems with horizontal legends that weren't always displaying the last few entries.

Corrected unusual behavior in filter values when a filter existed on both a column and a set--which was comprised in part from that same column). Unusual behavior sometimes occurred when deselecting combinations of values from the base column and members of the set.

The tooltip user-experience was improved, including decreasing the time the tooltip displays after you've moved your mouse.

Corrected problems when connecting to Tableau Server through an SSL proxy.

Content Administrators were not able to successfully add users via importing a CSV file. This issue has been corrected.

A problem with the "Last viewed" timestamp was corrected.

Publishing very large data sources could cause the error "Internal server error. Response code: 500". This issue has been fixed.

Clicking the Clear button to "Clear my saved passwords" on the User Account page was not working. It now works correctly.

Changes were made related to jruby temp directories, including modifying the 'tabadmin cleanup' command so that it removes them when executed.

Users logged into a site other than the Default site were not able to change their passwords. This issue has been corrected.

Date range quick filters could have the end date type-in field incorrectly sized. This caused the first few characters that were typed in to not appear. This issue has been corrected.

Tabadmin.exe was not running correctly when invoked from a directory other than the Tableau Server\bin directory. This has been corrected and you can now run tabadmin from any directory.

Fixed an issue where a workbook with a single select filter containing one selected option looked correct in Desktop but incorrect when published to Tableau Server.

Corrected an issue that was causing workbooks connecting to a Teradata database to intermittently fail to load.

Downloading workbooks from a version 7.0 server could fail with error "You don't have permission to access <workbook> on this server" or "An error occurred when loading from the Tableau Server". This would occur on systems using Active Directory (AD) with either a large number of security groups or groups that spanned multiple AD domains. This problem has been corrected.

Tableau Server users running Internet Explorer 7 or 8 were unable to download exported data, crosstabs, or PDFs from an SSL-enabled Tableau Server -- even though their license level should have allowed them to do so. This problem has been fixed.

Tableau trusted authentication would not correctly authenticate a session if the workbook or site the workbook belonged to was named 'trusted'.

Corrected a display problem with horizontal legends getting scroll bars that obscure the legend entries.

When a view was embedded inside an Iframe that used a URL action that was run on "Menu" with &:linktarget=_self added to the end of the embedded URL, it did not open the action inside the same window as requested. Instead, it incorrectly opened the target in a new tab. This has been corrected and the linktarget=value is now honored.

Certain session-related 500 errors were not being handled correctly, resulting in views that wouldnâ€™t finish loading (permanent â€œspinnersâ€?). This issue has been fixed.

Tooltips would disappear too quickly when using Internet Explorer browsers, making it difficult to select links in the tooltip. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a potential security vulnerability where Get requests to Tableau Server could potentially be exploited to run local JavaScript in the browser. This issue has been corrected.

Using tabcmd get <workbookname> for very large workbooks could cause tabcmd to fail with the error "*** failed to allocate memory". This issue has been corrected.

When an embedded view has reached a session timeout due to inactivity, on next reload it could display in a non-embedded mode (with the Tableau masthead). This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem when assigning permissions that could cause the error "Tableau Server encountered an error reading or writing data during the last request."

The &:revert=all URL parameter for embedded views was causing the error 'Session Ended by Server.' This issue has been corrected and this option now correctly restores the view back to its original state.

The options to suppress the Share and Download links on embedded views were being ignored. This has been corrected. These are controlled by the configuration settings 'tabadmin set vizqlserver.showshare false' and 'tabadmin set vizqlserver.showdownload false'.




Version 7.0 released January 17, 2012.
New Capabilities
Tableau 7.0 will empower you with new visualizations like filled maps and area charts. It is also easier to use with an improved Show Me interface, one-click sorting and interactive tooltips. Large organizations will love Multi-Tenancy and significantly improved scalability and performance.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
There were cases where you could assign the same alias to multiple values, which is generally not allowed. In these cases the change to the alias was not saved with the document. Tableau now provides a warning in all cases when incorrectly assigning a duplicate alias.

Corrected an issue when connecting to Oracle databases where the PLAN_TABLE$ could remain open even when the Tableau session had gone idle. This issue could potentially block other database maintenance tasks from happening.

Using table calculations could cause slight differences in the queries generated, which would cause Tableau to miss the query cache and needless queries would be sent to the database. This issue has been corrected.

Exporting to a crosstab when using Table Calculations could cause incorrect calculations in the exported data if the table calculation direction was swapped.

The option to display quick filters for hidden worksheets on a dashboard is now available.

Alias names for groups were lost when the field was duplicated. Aliases are now correctly retained.

Corrected the spelling of several Norwegian state/county names for the Tableau Geocoding matches.

Optimized performance when creating incremental updates. In one scenario of an extract with 32 million rows, performing an incremental update was reduced from 23 minutes and 38 seconds to 1 minute and 16 seconds.

Tableau Desktop now prevents workbooks that use extracts created in version 5 or earlier from being published to the server. The extract in the workbook must first be upgraded to a data engine format prior to publishing.

Tableau will no longer load DLLs from the working directory (the directory where a .twb file is being opened from). This prevents one form of security vulnerability where an attacker could put a malicious DLL into the same directory as the .twb file being opened.

Pressing Ctrl + C on your keyboard to copy data selected in the filter dialog once again performs the copy as it did in version 5.

Optimized performance when calculating quick filters. One example of the improvement is when opening a particular workbook with many quick filters. The time to open (including the time to initially calculate the quick filter values) went from 429 seconds to 112 seconds.

Setting the confidence intervals for reference lines now includes the option to specify any value from 0 to 100, rather than only a list of pre-defined values.

The Force Y intercept to zero trend line option is no longer disabled for continuous dates.

Corrected an issue that prevented connecting to Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP provider version 10 (pre-Denali) data sources using an Analysis Services OLAP provider version 11 (Denali) driver.

Renamed the geographic role for CBSAs (core based statistical areas) to better reflect that MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas) are also part of this option.

Importing text files into a Tableau extract could in some cases add extra blank rows to the end of the data. This issue has been corrected.

Creating an extract with the option to Aggregate Data for Visible Dimensions now correctly aggregates all measures.

Tableau now warns you when trying to saving a workbook to a read-only folder.

Saving a custom table calculation when using Measure Values on the Text shelf and filtering Measure Names to show only one measure would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Large append extracts would sometimes fail when combining the new data with the existing. Some of these cases have been corrected and additional logging has been added to help with future related issues.

Tableau Server
The tabcmd refreshextracts command was not working when the workbook name included spaces. This issue has been corrected.

Added a new configuration option, wgserver.logout.close_vizql_sessions, which can be set via the tabadmin utility. When set to yes, this option immediately destroys all vizql server sessions associated with a wgserver session at the time the browser logs out. Without this setting, the vizql server sessions remain allocated until the normal server session timeout setting. Immediately destroying the sessions at logout can slow down the logout command, but will free resources on the server and prevent accidental access to the session data when pressing the back button in the browser.

The version of the Apache HTTP Server included with Tableau Server has been updated to version 2.2.21.

Dynamic pages returned from Tableau Server now include 'cache-control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate' and 'pragma: no-cache' in the http headers.

The tabcmd refreshextracts command now includes the flag --incremental to instruct the server to do an incremental refresh.

When using Tableau Server to view a workbook created in a non-U.S. locale, clicking to edit Quick Filter Dates would cause the date value to revert to standard American date format (MM/DD/YYYY), instead of a locale appropriate format. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to Tableau Server from earlier versions of Desktop required the publish right. This restriction has been lifted to provide access to the Data Server. Desktop users now only need a valid account on the server to connect and no longer require the publish right.

Null filter values now correctly displays as blank instead of zero.

Corrected an issue where all server users were periodically set to 'Unlicensed.'

Installing a worker server and configuring it to run the Data Engine could cause the configuration process to stall. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server views now correctly show scrollbars in the view when running on Safari on Mac OS X Lion (10.7).

Corrected a security vulnerability where the /users page could be a vehicle for a SQL injection attack.

Tableau Server now allows usernames from Active Directory to be longer than 20 characters.

Corrected several unusual behaviors with single select quick filters when using multidimensional (cube) data sources on an iPad.

Tooltips would disappear too quickly when using Internet Explorer browsers, making it difficult to select links in the tooltip. This issue has been corrected.

In the mobile client, clearing the "All" option on an exclusive quick filter now selects the other marks and excludes them as expected.

Corrected a case where tabadmin license --repair_service was not correctly repairing the service.

Additional Considerations
Tableau Server is no longer supported on Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems.

Tableau Server installs do not correctly complete when the Regional Language option of Windows is set to Simplified Chinese. Change the language option to US English then install the product. After the install completes, you can change the setting back.

When connected to Tableau Server through an SSL proxy, the navigation links along the left side of the server pages point to the actual server instead of the proxy. This issue will be corrected in an upcoming maintenance release.

Upgrading to Tableau Server 7.0 from earlier versions doesnâ€™t always show a progress dialog box. Version 7.0 introduces a new repository so the upgrade requires migrating old workbooks to the new repository. If you have many workbooks, the upgrade can take longer than usual and will appear unresponsive without the progress dialog. Learn more about Upgrading Tableau Server and troubleshoot errors that can occur during migration.

When embedding Tableau Server views into other applications there is no longer the option to display comments as part of the embedded content.

Tableau products now require your computer to have at least a Pentium 4 (released in 2001) or ADM Opteron (released in 2003) processor. These are the first processors which include the SSE2 instruction set which Tableau now requires.

The tabcmd utility and the Tableau Configuration program may perform more slowly than prior releases. These performance slowdowns will be addressed in a future maintenance release.

Embedded views do not include comments regardless of whether the comments parameter is included. Comments are no longer included with embedded views.

Tabadmin fills disk space with unnecessary temporary files each time it is used. This is especially a problem when using the tabadmin status command. This issue will be fixed in a future maintenance release.




Version 6.1.12 released January 11, 2013.
This release includes an important security patch for Tableau Server. The patch addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails code, an open source web development framework that is a component of the Tableau Server architecture. 

Tableau strongly recommends upgrading to Tableau Server version 6.1.12 as soon as possible. For a detailed description of the vulnerabilities, see the Ruby on Rails website: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org

Tableau 6.1.12 is the same product as 6.1.11 with the above issue corrected. There are no other changes in this release.




Version 6.1.11 released July 2, 2012.
Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
There were no changes in Tableau Desktop for this release. You can continue to use 6.1.10 as the current version.

Tableau Server
Tableau Server failed to import certain Active Directory groups because their names contained special characters that Tableau Server didn't recognize. This issue has been corrected.

Previously, the vizql server process would sometimes hang after stopping and starting the server. This issue has been addressed and the process now executed correctly.

After restarting Tableau Server, the wgserver process sometimes failed to stop and start. This issue has been corrected.



Version 6.1.10 released May 24, 2012.
Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Updated the Microsoft MSVC runtime DLLs to the latest 2010 SP1 versions to pick up security fixes from Microsoft.

When connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services Cube data source, quick filters for a boolean table calculation would not update correctly. For example, clearing "False" would filter the data but the quick filter would still show a check mark next to "False." This issue has been corrected and the quick filter now correctly reflects the filter state.

Dual axis charts would attempt to align zeros even when the "Include Zero" option was not selected. This behavior has been changed to not align zeroes unless "Include Zero" is selected for both axes.

Progress OpenEdge connections were not handling bit/boolean (logical) fields properly when using Custom SQL. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where views would not update after changing to a new user in the user filter. The workbook now updates correctly.

When refreshing or removing an extract, which had previously been published to the data serve using embedded database credentials there were cases where it would not be able to complete the refresh of the extract. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a discrepancy in DATE_TRUNC functions results between a live Aster connection and working with an extract from an Aster database. The Aster database calculated dates with Monday as the first day of the week. Tableau uses Sunday as the first day. This difference is now accounted for when creating extracts from Aster.

Groups and manual sort orders were not always maintained correctly when connecting to SQL Server databases. This issue has been corrected.

Enabled a TDC customization for Oracle data sources, that allows you to set CAP_QUERY_SUBQUERY_QUERY_CONTEXT to avoid expensive queries involving temporary tables. You can learn about TDC customization in the Customizing and Tuning ODCB Connections article.

Support was added for the SQL Server 2012 driver.

Tableau Server
Previously, there were some issues with product keys sometimes appearing twice on the Licenses page. This has been fixed.

Corrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.

Fixed an issue where pausing "Automatic Updates" on a published view, changing quick filters, then resuming the updates resulted in a blank view.

The --administrator option is one of the options you can use with the tabcmd syncgroup command. In earlier versions it assigned the Administrator user right to a group of users. Now it also allows you to designate an Administrator type of system, content, or none.

Several security improvements were made, including better prevention of SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.




Version 6.1.9 released April 2, 2012.
This release is an emergency update to address the following product issue in Tableau Server version 6.1.8. It does not affect Tableau Desktop.

In the 6.1.9 Tableau Server release, there were problems with dashboards not refreshing correctly after certain actions were performed. Some examples of these actions include drawing a zoom box, changing a quick filter, or doing a 'Keep Only' or 'Exclude.' The underlying issue that was causing these problems has been corrected.

Tableau Server 6.1.9 is the same product at 6.1.8 with the above issues corrected. There are no other changes in this release. Tableau Desktop is not affected. Your existing 6.1.x, Desktop products will continue to work with the 6.1.9 Server.



Version 6.1.8 released March 22, 2012.
New Capabilities
Added support for connecting to Teradata 14.0.

Added support for connecting to Progress OpenEdge 11.0.

Added support for the 4.6.3 Aster nCluster ODBC driver. If that driver is installed it will be used to connect to Aster Ncluster databases version 4.6 and higher. Using this driver corrects a memory problem when performing large queries.

Added support for connecting to Vertica 5.1.

Corrected Issues
Tableau Desktop
Updated the error message that displays in the calculated field dialog box when using the Modulo function with a non integer value.

When exporting data to Microsoft Access, the resulting table would sort the columns alphabetically based on their underlying column names instead of the aliases in Tableau. These columns are now sorted based on their Tableau aliases during export.

Tableau Server
Corrected several cases where the zoom control was not always appearing on certain views.

Quick filter titles now load correctly in Google Chrome version 16.0.912.77.

Data connections using ODBC were not correctly embedding passwords. This issue has been fixed.

Tableau Server now correctly sets its cookies with the secure flag in a proxy server environment in which the proxy is configured for SSL but Tableau Server is not.

In situations where multiple groups were in the Groups page of Tableau Server, all members of each group were displayed, and not in alphabetical order. Now, lists of 10-15 members display in alphabetical order and a "More..." link lets you see additional group members.



Version 6.1.7 released February 21, 2012.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected some cases where logarithmic axis labeling would show fewer tick mark labels than expected.

Corrected the placement of zip code 49931.

Optimized performance when opening workbooks with large extracts and a large number of unique dimension values in the worksheet. One example is a workbook with a 60 million row extract and over 2 million unique values in a field on the row shelf. This workbook originally took over 10 minutes to open and now takes about 2 minutes.

Changing the data type of a field from Date to String would cause the quick filter for that field to disappear after saving and reopening the workbook.

On the Start page, thumbnail images for workbooks opened from an SSL-enabled server now properly include the https part of the URL.

While creating an extract, if the connection between Tableau and the database server is interrupted, Tableau Desktop could unexpectedly exit. This issue has been fixed.

When refreshing an extract that includes a calculated string field that uses a string field from a secondary datasource, the connection to the secondary data source would not prompt to log in and would then fail. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem creating an extract from MySQL columns defined as a Time() datatype.

In rare cases, opening a packaged workbook (twbx) file would fail with the error "Unspecified error." The underlying problem was the packaged file contained an embedded image that was created without a modified date property. This issue has been corrected.

After selecting File > Print to PDF, immediately cancelling could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Corrected display problems with horizontal legends getting scroll bars that obscure the legend entries.

When a view was embedded inside an Iframe that used a URL action that was run on "Menu" with &:linktarget=_self added to the end of the embedded URL, it did not open the action inside the same window as requested. Instead, it incorrectly opened the target in a new tab. This has been corrected and the linktarget=value is now honored.

Certain session-related 500 errors were not being handled correctly, resulting in views that wouldnâ€™t finish loading (permanent â€œspinnersâ€?). This issue has been fixed.

Tooltips would disappear too quickly when using Internet Explorer browsers, making it difficult to select links in the tooltip. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a potential security vulnerability where Get requests to Tableau Server could potentially be exploited to run local JavaScript in the browser. This has been corrected.

Using tabcmd get <workbookname> for very large workbooks could cause tabcmd to fail with the error "*** failed to allocate memory". This issue has been corrected.

When an embedded view has reached a session timeout due to inactivity, on next reload it could display in non-embedded mode (with the Tableau masthead). This has been corrected.

Corrected a problem when assigning permissions that could cause the error "Tableau Server encountered an error reading or writing data during the last request."

Corrected unusual behavior in filter values when a filter exists on both a column and a set which is comprised in part from that same column. Unusual behavior could occur when deselecting combinations of values from the base column and members of the set.




Version 6.1.6 released January 17, 2012.
Tableau Desktop
Importing text files into a Tableau Extract could in some cases add extra blank rows to the end of the data. This issue has been corrected.

Creating an extract with the option to Aggregate Data for Visible Dimensions now correctly aggregates all measures.

Tableau now warns you when trying to saving a workbook to a read-only folder.

Saving a custom table calculation when using Measure Values on the Text shelf and filtering Measure Names to show only one measure would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Large append extracts would sometimes fail when combining the new data with the existing. Some of these cases have been corrected and additional logging has been added to help with future related issues.

Tableau Server
Null filter values now correctly displays as blank instead of zero.

Corrected an issue where all server users were periodically set to 'Unlicensed.'

Installing a worker server and configuring it to run the Data Engine could cause the configuration process to stall. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server views now correctly show scrollbars in the view when running on Safari on Mac OS X Lion (10.7).

Corrected a security vulnerability where the /users page could be a vehicle for a SQL injection attack.

Tableau Server now allows for usernames from Active Directory to be longer than 20 characters.

Corrected several unusual behaviors with single select quick filters when using multidimensional (cube) data sources on an iPad.

Tooltips would disappear too quickly when using Internet Explorer browsers, making it difficult to select links in the tooltip. This issue has been corrected.

In the mobile client, clearing the "All" option on an exclusive quick filter now selects the other marks and excludes them as expected.

Corrected a case where tabadmin license --repair_service was not correctly repairing the service.



Version 6.1.5 released December 6, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Parameter controls with the Float data type would not always show the last value in the range due to rounding precision. For example the parameter may be defined to go from 0.1 to 1.2 incrementing by 0.1. The max value displayed in the slider would be 1.1 instead of 1.2. The full range now displays correctly.

Views with context filters based on a parameter now update when the parameter changes.

A filter action that Excludes All Values when the selection is cleared could cause a Tableau runtime error when clicking in a white area to clear a selection. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where the Microsoft SQL Server name was limited to the size of the text box in the connect dialog box (roughly 30 characters).

Using a workbook that connects to an extract from a text file and has a calculated field could incorrectly cause an "Ignoring calculated field" error if a new calculated field with the same name is added to the extract.

Corrected an issue with creating extracts from Hadoop Hive data sources with long character data.

Corrected an issue creating a calculated field with a CASE statement that uses a parameter value in the formula.

Tableau Server
Corrected a drawing issue on Internet Explorer 7 where compact quick filters would not initially draw the drop-down arrow control.

When viewing a tabbed workbook, the size of all dashboards is now examined to determine the best size. Dashboards set to Automatic size are now considered to be the 'maximum' size, so a fixed size dashboard will not incorrectly constrain an automatic dashboard, which depends on the size of the browser window and can be bigger than the fixed size.

Corrected a case where quick filters would erroneously display horizontally rather than vertically, causing scroll bars to appear.

Embedding a view into an iFrame and including ?:comments=yes was not displaying the comments area. This issue has been corrected.

The "Run Now" menu option for refreshing extracts wasn't showing for Content Administrators. This command is now correctly available.

Custom shapes were lost when performing a scheduled incremental refresh of a workbook. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem where saving custom views via the Remember My Changes link would not always save the changes. This problem would occur when a workbook with a single view or dashboard was published to the server with the Show Views as Tabs option enabled.

Corrected a problem introduced in version 6.1.4 where using a quick filter with the All option could cause the first click on an individual value in the list to deselect all other values.

Optimized performance for servers that have a large number of scheduled jobs. The optimization trims completed job records from the metadata tables. The default behavior is to always remove completed job data older than 30 days. The number of days value can be set by the configuration parameter purge.jobs.retention_days.

Corrected an error when creating PDF output for a view that uses a font that does not exist on the Tableau Server machine.

Corrected an issue with certain quick filters and blank values in the display that would cause the view to not load on the iPad.

Corrected an intermittent problem where quick filter titles could overlap the filter values.

Optimized how permissions are set on members of a group. Previously the application could hit memory errors when changing permissions on a group with 30,000 members and take upwards of 12 minutes. The optimization now completes the task in 30 seconds and consumes minimal memory.

Corrected a difference in how Desktop and Server handle filter actions when the filters were updating multiple views on a dashboard. The server no longer requires a manual refresh to completely display the view.



Version 6.1.4 released November 9, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Improved connectivity to SAS databases when using the ODBC connector. The changes implemented now allow successful connections to SAS.

Connecting to Aster databases that contain an underscore character ( _ ) in the schema name now completes correctly.

Updated the geocoding position of the Papua New Guinea states.

Added support for boolean data types when connecting to Progress OpenEdge databases.

Tooltips now show the correct justification instead of always left aligning the content. A block of measures/dimensions will all inherit their alignment from the first row in the block. Individual lines of regular text can be aligned as desired.

Reduced 'Not enough storage is available to process this command.' errors when creating extracts.

Corrected a problem that was causing errors "Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: Bad Allocation" and "Tableau Data Engine Error: 8: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host." The underlying problem was Tableau miscalculating the size of computed columns when materializing calculations.

The following special characters can now be used in aliases, parameter names, set names, group names, and sheet names: */\?|<>:"

Corrected a case where publishing a workbook to Tableau Server would fail when it is connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database that includes a filter on a computed member.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when dropping a field onto the view. This issue was caused by an invalid field name being dropped. One possible cause was incorrectly handling Asian character field names on an English system. There are other possible causes. Tableau now displays a message when it cannot work correctly with a field name.

Using Measure Names/Measure Values fields in a text table would not correctly export the aliases for the column names when exporting the crosstab to Excel. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to Oracle databases where NLS_SORT= is set to a value other than Binary (which is the default) Tableau filters could return unpredictable results when using more than a handful of values in the filter. This issue has been corrected by detecting the value and aligning the use of NLS_SORT and NLS_COMP to both use Binary for the session.

Saving a workbook that has secondary data sources that were created by pasting data now correctly saves the secondary data source with the workbook.

Tableau Server
The search box was incorrectly including the carriage return character as part of the search string. This issue has been corrected.

The (All) option and the Show Fewer option on quick filters now work correctly when used together.

Accessing a Tableau Server running SSL from Mobile Safari on an iPad running iOS 4.3.5 could cause the browser to not log in correctly (although the iPad application would work). This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where quick filters would erroneously display horizontally rather than vertical, causing scroll bars to appear.

Quick filter slider controls were not correctly displaying the minus sign for all negative values. This issue has been corrected.

Added a '-p' switch to the 'tabadmin ziplogs' command, which includes the PostgreSQL data folder('psql/data') into the resulting zip file. Including this switch is sometimes helpful when working with Tableau Support to diagnosis problems.

Corrected an issue where certain workbooks that use parameter sliders with the show readout option disabled stopped the view from loading.

Filter actions that navigate to another tab in the workbook could sometimes fail to switch tabs. The underlying problem was a conflict with a tooltip message trying to display at the same time a tab switch was being requested. This issue has been corrected.

Views with maps accessed on mobile devices would not scroll correctly. This issue has been corrected.




Version 6.1.3 released October 5, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a case when using quick filters for certain calculated fields. Filter values would get confused between mixed, lower, and upper case comparisons.

Changing the locale of the workbook would not correctly update date formats for values that appear in titles and captions. This issue has been corrected.

The help text for the Replace() function that appears in the calculated field dialog is now localized for the French and German versions.

Tableau now correctly retains sort and grouping information when connected to a SQL Server database that uses the database collation SQL_Latin1_General_Cp1253_CI_AS.

Corrected an issue that was causing the error "A character string failed conversion to a numeric value." when connecting to certain Teradata databases.

Tableau now correctly matches character values when opening a saved workbook that connects to a SQL Server database that uses the collation SQL_Latin1_General_Cp1_CI_AI.

Corrected an issue where Tableau could generate the message "Unhandled Exception" when closing a workbook that uses an Extract. The workbook was never corrupted, Tableau would just display this message when closing it.

Single quotes in Group names could cause a problem when using User Filters. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when using the Advanced option to specify the Compute using fields for a table calculation.

Tableau Server
Using the Data Connections administrator page to change the attributes of an Oracle database connection would not correctly update connections with embedded passwords (even if modifying other attributes). This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue with tabcmd incorrectly processing commands from a file that included UTF8 or UTF16 encoded values (e.g., usernames in Chinese).

Enabled zoom and pan for dual axis charts in the iPad application.

Compact list quick filters can display an option for "(Multiple Values)" in certain cases. In these cases, the selection of the first item in the list would not correctly process the selection until another values was selected.

Corrected a case where the Tableau Service (tabsvc) would not automatically start after rebooting a machine. The service setting (set either automatic or manual) was not correctly retained when making server configuration changes.

The Users/Groups list that displays when editing project permissions is now displayed in the correct alphabetical order.

Corrected a case where a dashboard with multiple views using a synchronized Pages shelf were not updating together.

Certain poor network conditions could cause connections to Teradata databases to freeze a VizQL process resulting in views timing out. Implemented a change to more aggressively instruct the Teradata drivers to stop attempting to display network issue warnings in a dialog, which was causing the VizQL process to freeze.

Backgrounder processes would become unresponsive sporadically and were not automatically restarting themselves. This issue has been corrected.



Version 6.1.2 released September 15, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Creating an extract from a text file could cause an "Invalid datetime value" error when a Date/Time field contains number values that are not valid dates. The extract now completes as expected.

When connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database, fields that contained decimal values would display as #Error in the view when the system locale did not match the database locale. These values are now displayed correctly.

The default name when creating a calculated field would not increment correctly causing duplicate name errors. The default name is now "Calculation1", "Calculation2", and so on.

Corrected an issue where a workbook with large CASE statements in a calculated field would take substantially longer to open than in version 6.0.

Corrected a case where creating a bar graph with all zero values would place the zero at the center of the axis and extend the bars to the bottom of the graph implying negative values.

The application would unexpectedly exit when opening specific workbooks that were not properly cleaned up when saved. This issue has been corrected.

Connection names with a colon (:) in them would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit when creating an extract. The following characters are no longer allowed in connection names: * < > ? | / \ :

The message "measure expressions must be aggregate or depend only on group-by columns" would needlessly display when editing certain Table Calculations. Dismissing the message would continue correctly. The message is no longer displayed in these cases.

Connections to OData data sources was incorrectly converting periods (.) in column names into underscore characters, which made Tableau unable to retrieve the data. Tableau no longer converts characters in the column names.

Changing the fiscal year start when connected to Microsoft Analysis Services databases would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when adding sheets to a dashboard.

When using an ODBC connection, entering an incorrect password could cause certain connection attributes to reset, which would then cause connection problems. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected the problem of displaying the message "Intermediate version has expired" or "Intermediate version expiring in x days" when launching Tableau, which would not allow the application to proceed when expired.

Tableau Server
Tableau Servers deployed behind proxy servers or certain firewall configurations were not loading views to users on the outside network. This issue has been corrected.

When a workbook scheduled for full and incremental refreshes was downloaded, the incremental refresh settings weren't retained. This issue has been corrected.

Incremental scheduled refreshes would not update after a scheduled full extract refresh was run. This issue has been corrected.

Clearing the 'All' check box in a multiple value list Quick Filter now visually clears all the individual items. This behavior correctly matches Tableau Desktop.

Corrected a case where multiple value list Quick Filters with the (All) option enabled would not resize correctly to account for the (All) member. This would result in a scroll bar for the list of items.




Tableau Desktop
Databases with bigint data types could cause problems when using Tableau datepart functions creating overflow conditions. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue with computing a median when using a Tableau Extract that would result in an error "The data source returned more than one total for a set of data values."

Added a REPLACE() function for a number of data sources. This function will replace all instances of a set of characters with a different set of characters. For example REPLACE("Calculation","ion","ed") = Calculated 

This function is available when connected to Tableau Extracts, DB2, Firebird, Cache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Vertica, Aster nCluster, Greenplum, ParAccel, Progress OpenEdge and Sybase IQ, as well as any ODBC data source that supports the {fn REPLACE(..)} ODBC scalar function.

Lifted the requirement that Vertica drivers match the Vertica database version being connected to. This change now allows using a Vertica 4.1 driver to connect to both Vertica 5 databases and pre-4.1 databases.

Workbook and extract files that have a total of 260 characters or more in the combined file name and path cannot be published to Tableau Server. A warning message is now displayed when this limit is exceeded.

Corrected several issues where importing a sheet from a Bookmark could then put the workbook into an unstable state that could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. The instability was created when mapping the data source from the bookmark into either existing or new data sources in the target workbook.

Corrected a query error that could occur when using multiple tables and joins when connecting to Microsoft Access databases.

When connecting to JET-based data sources (Excel, CSV, Access) column names with leading or trailing spaces could cause errors when selecting View Data. This issue has been corrected.

Parameter controls with the Float data type would not always show the last value in the range due to rounding precision. For example the parameter may be defined to go from 0.1 to 1.2 incrementing by 0.1. The max value displayed in the slider would be 1.1 instead of 1.2. This issue has been corrected and the full value range now is available.

When using a multidimensional data source and exporting a dashboard to a PDF, the values in quick filters could appear as fully described member names rather than member values. This issue has been corrected.

Changing the Compute Relative To setting for table calculations would revert to the original setting each time the calculation was edited. This issue has been corrected.

When a worksheet has invalid fields on it (indicated by the red exclamation point), creating a new parameter or renaming a calculated field could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Editing a set that was created from a single-level hierarchy in a cube data source would not show any values in the edit dialog. This issue has been corrected.

Searching for a value in a set that was created from a single-level hierarchy in a cube data source now correctly performs the search.

An action on a dashboard that navigates to another dashboard with an empty sheet on it could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Added the ability to disable ODBC connection pooling via the Connection Customization facility. This is useful for certain ODBC drivers to avoid driver conflicts.

Corrected a case where Tableau would not open a particular saved workbook, instead giving the message, 'Access violation - no RTTI data!'

Corrected a security vulnerability where Tableau would load certain Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) from the directory the workbook is being opened from. The correction is to only load these DLLs from the directory where the Tableau application is installed.

Using an Extract and a DATETRUNC function could cause errors with Filter Actions. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
The 'Run Now' command is now two individual options in the Full Refresh and Incremental Refresh drop down menus on the Tasks page for a workbook. This change lets you selectively trigger either type of refresh extract.

Corrected a case where an action on a dashboard was triggering a filter and the mouse movement was simultaneously asking for a tooltip to display. In this case a "Session Busy. Please retry later" message was shown.

Pan and zoom gestures on mobile devices now require the filter permission to be active. They no long are enabled for just people with the default viewer permission.

Tableau Server relative date filters were showing the first day of the week as Monday, rather than Sunday. While the calculations were performed correctly, the display was wrong. The date filters are now displayed correctly with Sunday as the first day.

The CSV file created from the View Data toolbar button was not correctly handling carriage return characters in the data which would cause multiple rows in the output file. This issue has been corrected.

When working with Custom Value List quick filters on the iPad, the view would not always update immediately after entering a value. Rather, it would update after the second value was entered. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where exporting data as a CSV file from Tableau Server could cause the data rows to be repeated. This issue would happen when using a single view with multiple panes.

Corrected the cause of 'Gdiplus err=2' and 'Gdiplus Err=3' messages which could occur with some Tableau Server views.

Corrected a case where Tableau Server would display a blank or partially blank view. In this case, the server log files would show the entry 'Gdiplus error code is Invalid Parameter.'

The browser back button now correctly moves to prior tabs in a workbook if an action loads a new tab.

A radio button single value quick filter could get into a state where none of the options are selected. This issue has been corrected.

Wildcard filters on a dashboard were not always including other global filters on sets. This issue has been corrected.



Version 6.1 released July 29, 2011.
Tableau 6.1 is loaded with new features. We've added incremental updates, faster extracts, and for the first time, the Desktop application is available in French and German. We're also introducing Tableau for iPad. Tableau Server views are now optimized to deliver touch experiences when accessed on devices like the Apple iPad. These are all just the beginning of what's new in this version.

See what's new in Tableau 6.1 +

Specific corrections and improvements are listed below.

Tableau Desktop
Corrected an issue where workbooks would continue to prompt for a password for Microsoft Access databases even when the password was removed on the database.

Custom color palettes for quantitative color encoding, map data layers, and reference bands are now included in the workbook or bookmark so that the views look the same wherever they are opened (e.g., Server, other machines, etc.).

When using Custom Value List and Wildcard Match quick filters, typing in all capital letters or all lower case letters performs a case insensitive search. Mixed case strings will rely on the underlying database for whether the search is case sensitive. This change also affects Search in quick filters.

Connecting to an Analysis Services cube with the same level names in multiple hierarchies would not properly highlight selections when the same named level from the different hierarchies was added to the view.

Connecting to an Analysis Services cube with the same level names in multiple hierarchies would not properly apply URL filters to the expected dimension.

Removing the last display of a hidden sheet now provides an option to either delete or unhide the sheet. Prior releases would simply warn it will be deleted.

Changing the definition of a Table Calculation no longer resets the formatting and axis label customization previously made to the Table Calculation field.

Changed the decimal rounding routines to be consistent. Prior to this change certain decimal values could be rounded down rather than up when truncating the display. For example 2.050000000000 could round to 2.0 rather than 2.1. 

Blending data from a relational source into a Microsoft Analysis Service cube could end up missing some values from the cube that actually exist. This has been corrected.

A case was corrected where a dashboard with horizontal layout containers could go into a loop during the rendering process. The case was with a particular combination of sizes and blank areas inside the layout container.

Tableau bookmarks were not saving custom relationship settings used in data blending.

Hovering over a mark would not show the tooltip for the mark when the automatic updates setting was disabled. This issue has been corrected.

When an axis in a scatter plot was clicked, it incorrectly triggered select actions for the marks in the view. This problem has been fixed.

If the output of a calculated field in a secondary data source was used as the linking field for data blending and was not included in the view itself, the view did not refresh automatically when edits were saved to the calculated field on the secondary connection. This issue has been corrected.

Modifying the relationship definition in data blending by removing a relationship did not automatically refresh the view. This has been corrected and now, when the relationship changes, the view is updated immediately.

Corrected a case where Tableau was not properly disconnecting from Oracle Essbase databases.

Replace References now correctly includes the replacement in bins, groups, relationship for data blending, and fields in calculations in secondary data sources.

There was an issue in which selecting multiple tabs in a workbook, using shift + select, then changing the Page Setup options resulted in an incorrect copy of the first sheet's Title and Caption to all the selected sheets. This issue has been corrected.

Implemented a performance optimization when opening workbooks with more than 10,000 values in a color or shape encoding.

Implemented a performance optimization when querying Tableau Extracts and using CASE statements.

Corrected the geolocation of a number of elements, including zip codes 92376, 90275, and 90731, as well as a number of states and provinces across Eastern Europe and China.

Improved the visual smoothness of animated playback when using the high speed playback option for complex or multi-pane views.

Optimized queries against MySQL databases when one of the columns in the table was of an enum data type. Prior to this change, Tableau would needlessly include substring() functions around all string columns in the query, which could potentially impact performance.

a visual artifact that was incorrectly appearing as a small triangle off the coast of southern Australia.

Optimized queries generated to Microsoft Analysis Services cubes when using slicing filters with the 'All' option selected.

Substitution variables for limits in titles were not correctly substituting the values. This has been corrected.

An 'Automatic' option was added to the Mark Halo color options. This allows the halo color to adjust automatically based on the background color of the underlying view. For example, with dark maps the halo color switches from white to black when automatic is selected.

Geocoding data matches now are case-, accent-, and punctuation-insensitive. For example, "Cordoba", "CORDOBA" and "CÓRDOBA" all match.

Previously, hidden worksheets in dashboards did not re-hide themselves if you navigated from the hidden sheet to a different dashboard than where you started. This has been corrected and the sheets now always automatically re-hide themselves.

Map labels for countries of Congo-Kinshasa and Congo-Brazzaville were reversed. This issue has been corrected.

Using Vertica 4.0 or higher now requires using a Vertica 4.0 or higher ODBC driver. This is because Tableau now supports the Vertica extended string syntax that was added in Vertica 4.0. Tableau recommends that you use the same version of Vertica ODBC driver and Vertica database. For example, if you have the 4.1 Vertica database, you should use the 4.1 driver; if you have the 4.0 database, use the 4.0 driver.

When connecting to OData data sources, Tableau would not correctly read short date formats. This issue has been corrected.

The installer is now distributed as an .EXE file rather than as a .MSI.

A problem was corrected where the substitution variable sometimes caused the error: "Error parsing date '%s'" This would only occur when the workbook was created on a computer with one locale (regional setting) and opened on a computer with a different locale.

Corrected an issue that could cause Tableau Server to return the error "Gdiplus error code is Invalid Parameter."

Tableau Server
The tabsvc.yml setting gateway.trusted is now automatically added to the gateway.trusted_hosts list. As a result, external proxy servers referenced by IP address in a user's browser will now correctly detect the IP address of the user's machine.

Tableau Server now displays the names of views, instead of titles, as their identifiers (e.g., in search results). Upgrade customers will keep the pre-6.1 behavior but can use the tabadmin command "wgserver.show_view_titles_not_names" to change it.

Views can now be embedded into SharePoint in multi-domain Active Directory environments using trusted tickets.

The Apache web server provided in version 6.1 has been upgraded to version 2.2.17.

Several issues have been resolved related to tabcmd accepting and processing unicode files.

Searching workbooks within a selected project now displays results only from within that project.

You can now publish workbooks with extracts larger than 2 GB. Note that some limitations are imposed by Tableau Server timeout settings and how much free disk space is available.

The project formerly named "default" is now named "Default".

Safari and Chrome web browsers have built-in spell checking for text boxes. In previous versions of Tableau Server, the username text box in the Login page would be spell-checked. This behavior has been disabled.

The Revert toolbar button restores the view back to the published or saved state.

Several fixes have been made to improve the layout and rendering of server pages, including truncating names of groups, projects, workbooks, and views when the names are extremely long.

When you look at your workbooks on the server in List mode, clicking on the right-most Tabs columns now sorts tabbed workbooks to the top of the list.

The Type column on the Data Sources page no longer appears to support sorting. In earlier versions, clicking on this column resulted in a server error.

Hierarchical filter names were being truncated if the name included a period. This issue has been corrected. 

Several optimizations have been made to handle temp files that result from an unexpected server shutdown. 

When a view's data was updated using the "Refresh Data" button, the timestamp for the update was not being refreshed. This problem has been corrected.

Published views using Compact List quick filters sometimes didn't correctly render the drop-down label or list contents for certain web browsers and operating systems, including Firefox on the Mac OS. This issue has been corrected.

Views in your Favorites list now have icons.

Active Directory groups whose names include the ampersand symbol (&) are now imported correctly.

Username links in the Server Activity views (which are really URL actions in the view) would result in a 'page does not exist' error if the username included multiple periods in the name (e.g. fname.lname@yourorg.com). This issue has been corrected.

Published views created with quick filters behaved differently depending on whether the data source was SQL Server or MSAS. This issue has been corrected.

There were some intermittent problems with filter performance when switching between dashboards. This has been fixed.

You can create a quick filter for a measure, then format the measure. For example, values appear as a percentage or currency. There was an issue where these formatted measures would display correctly in Tableau Desktop but would change to a decimal format once published to Tableau Server. This problem has been corrected.

A problem was fixed related to high publishing volumes during the same or multiple server sessions.

Browser page titles (e.g., the name that's displayed in the tabbed pages of a web browser) have been changed. Now, browser page titles simply show the sheet name rather than having a preamble of Views: <sheetname> or Workbook: <workbookname>. This makes it easier to quickly pick the desired tab. In addition, the Tableau masthead area now shows the workbook name when displaying a tabbed view, or just the sheet name when displaying a single view.

Tableau Server session cookies are now protected with HTTPOnly and Secure flags, thus reducing the chance server sessions can be maliciously compromised.

The scripts dispatch.rb, dispatch.fcgi, and .htaccess were not being used by Tableau Server and are no longer installed.

In an earlier version, a date field created using a date hierarchy quick filter was truncated such that only the last three digits of the date displayed when the workbook was published. This problem has been corrected.



Version 6.0.13 released December 6, 2011.
Tableau Server
Optimized how permissions are set on members of a group. Previously the application could hit memory errors when changing permissions on a group with 30,000 members and take upwards of 12 minutes. The optimization now completes the task in 30 seconds and consumes minimal memory.

Corrected a difference in how Desktop and Server handle filter actions when the filters were updating multiple views on a dashboard. The server no longer requires a manual refresh to completely display the view.



Version 6.0.12 released November 9 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when dropping a field onto the view. This issue was caused by an invalid field name being dropped. One possible cause was incorrectly handling Asian character field names on an English system. There are other possible causes. Tableau now displays a message when it cannot work correctly with a field name.

Using Measure Names/Measure Values fields in a text table would not correctly export the aliases for the column names when exporting the crosstab to Excel. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to Oracle databases where NLS_SORT= is set to a value other than Binary (which is the default) Tableau filters could return unpredictable results when using more than a handful of values in the filter. This issue has been corrected by detecting the value and aligning the use of NLS_SORT and NLS_COMP to both use Binary for the session.

Saving a workbook that has secondary data sources that were created by pasting data now correctly saves the secondary data source with the workbook.



Version 6.0.11 released October 5, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected an issue where Tableau could generate the message "Unhandled Exception" when closing a workbook that uses an Extract. The workbook was never corrupted, Tableau would just display this message when closing it.

Single quotes in Group names could cause a problem when using User Filters. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when using the Advanced option to specify the Compute using fields for a table calculation.

Tableau Server
Corrected a case where the Tableau Service (tabsvc) would not automatically start after rebooting a machine. The service setting (set either automatic or manual) was not correctly retained when making server configuration changes.

The Users/Groups list that displays when editing project permissions is now displayed in the correct alphabetical order.

Corrected a case where a dashboard with multiple views using a synchronized Pages shelf were not updating together.

Certain poor network conditions could cause connections to Teradata databases to freeze a VizQL process resulting in views timing out. Implemented a change to more aggressively instruct the Teradata drivers to stop attempting to display network issue warnings in a dialog, which was causing the VizQL process to freeze.

Backgrounder processes would become unresponsive sporadically and were not automatically restarting themselves. This issue has been corrected.




Version 6.0.10 released September 15, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Connection names with a colon (:) in them would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit when creating an extract. The following characters are no longer allowed in connection names: * < > ? | / \ :

The message "measure expressions must be aggregate or depend only on group-by columns" would needlessly display when editing certain Table Calculations. Dismissing the message would continue correctly. The message is no longer displayed in these cases.

Connections to OData data sources was incorrectly converting periods (.) in column names into underscore characters, which made Tableau unable to retrieve the data. Tableau no longer converts characters in the column names.

Changing the fiscal year start when connected to Microsoft Analysis Services databases would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when adding sheets to a dashboard.

When using an ODBC connection, entering an incorrect password could cause certain connection attributes to reset, which would then cause connection problems. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Clearing the 'All' check box in a multiple value list Quick Filter now visually clears all the individual items. This behavior correctly matches Tableau Desktop.

Corrected a case where multiple value list Quick Filters with the (All) option enabled would not resize correctly to account for the (All) member. This would result in a scroll bar for the list of items.




Version 6.0.9 released August 17, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Workbook and extract files that have a total of 260 characters or more in the combined file name and path cannot be published to Tableau Server. A warning message is now displayed when this limit is exceeded.

Corrected several issues where importing a sheet from a Bookmark could then put the workbook into an unstable state that could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. The instability was created when mapping the data source from the bookmark into either existing or new data sources in the target workbook.

Corrected a query error that could occur when using multiple tables and joins when connecting to Microsoft Access databases.

When connecting to JET-based data sources (Excel, CSV, Access) column names with leading or trailing spaces could cause errors when selecting View Data. This issue has been corrected.

Parameter controls with the Float datatype would not always show the last value in the range due to rounding precision. For example the parameter may be defined to go from 0.1 to 1.2 incrementing by 0.1. The max value displayed in the slider would be 1.1 instead of 1.2. This issue has been corrected and the full value range now is available.

When using a multidimensional data source and exporting a dashboard to a PDF the values in quick filters could appear as fully described member names rather than member values. This issue has been corrected.

Changing the Compute Relative To setting for table calculations would revert to the original setting each time the calculation was edited. This issue has been corrected.

When a worksheet has invalid fields on it (indicated by the red exclamation point), creating a new parameter or renaming a calculated field could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Editing a set that was created from a single-level hierarchy in a cube data source would not show any values in the edit dialog. This issue has been corrected.

Searching for a value in a set that was created from a single-level hierarchy in a cube data source now correctly performs the search.

An action on a dashboard that navigates to another dashboard with an empty sheet on it could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Added the ability to disable ODBC connection pooling via the Connection Customization facility. This is useful for certain ODBC drivers to avoid driver conflicts.

Corrected a case where Tableau would not open a particular saved workbook, instead giving the message, 'Access violation - no RTTI data!'

Corrected a security vulnerability where Tableau would load certain Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) from the directory the workbook is being opened from. The correction is to only load these DLLs from the directory where the Tableau application is installed.

Using an Extract and a DATETRUNC function could cause errors with Filter Actions. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Corrected an issue where exporting data as a CSV file from Tableau Server could cause the data rows to be repeated. This issue would happen when using a single view with multiple panes.

Corrected the cause of 'Gdiplus err=2' and 'Gdiplus Err=3' messages which could occur with some Tableau Server views.

Corrected a case where Tableau Server would display a blank or partially blank view. In this case, the server log files would show the entry 'Gdiplus error code is Invalid Parameter.'

The browser back button now correctly moves to prior tabs in a workbook if an action loads a new tab.

A radio button single value quick filter could get into a state where none of the options are selected. This issue has been corrected.

Wildcard filters on a dashboard were not always including other global filters on sets. This issue has been corrected.




Version 6.0.8 released June 23, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Viewing data for the entire view (no selected marks) would cause an "Invalid field formula" error. This issue has been corrected.

Exporting a crosstab to Excel now correctly exports the data from the current page based on the fields on the Pages shelf rather than exporting the entire sheet, which could cause data from other pages to show in the exported crosstab.

Some table calculations would cause the error: "The input to TOTAL() must be from a single datasource." The error was caused by how the calculation is broken apart in order to process the query. This issue has been corrected.

The application would occasionally hang when it lost connection to the data source. This was caused by multiple progress dialog boxes that would interfere with each other. This issue has been corrected.

Creating an extract from a Vertica database could cause a COPY error. The error was caused by how Tableau was handling delimiter and escape characters when creating the extract. Tableau now follows the correct syntax in these cases.

When creating an extract from an Oracle database, an "Invalid datetime value" error would occur when the underlying database contains datetime columns that cannot be translated. The extract will no longer fail in these cases. The columns will exist in the extract but the invalid datetimes will have the value "Error."

When running on Windows 7 and Windows Vista and working with TWBX files the application could unexpectedly exit when closing the file and cleaning up the temporary files. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau now correctly warns you that you cannot assign a measure value an alias that already exists in the database. Previously no warning would be given and the duplicate alias would be used until you closed and reopened the workbook, where the measure would revert to its original value.

When using a quick filter on Measure Values, a calculated field that depends on a parameter would disappear from the quick filter when deselected. The calculated field now remains in the quick filter and is only removed from the view when deselected.

The application would unexpectedly exit when dragging a field to a legend (e.g., size, shape, color) while the Marks card is hidden. This issue has been corrected.

Performing a View Data with no values selected on a sheet that has a Table Calculation with a filter would show the message "The underlying data cannot be retrieved for this visualization without a selection." This issue has been corrected and the View Data action is now performed.

Improved logging so that all error messages are added to the log files along with any details and query information that is available.

Corrected an issue where the vertical scroll bar would not always show in a dashboard view that contains many columns.

The application would unexpectedly exit when removing sheets from dashboards with synchronized page controls. This issue has been corrected.

The application would sometimes unexpectedly exit when refreshing an extract that was created from a local file data source that relied on the JET database engine (e.g., Excel, Access, Text files). The underlying problem was JET unexpectedly returned a NULL value for the data collation.

When working with an MS Access 2010 database, a string comparison error, "The parameter is incorrect." could occur. This error occurred when the locale on the machine did not match the locale set for the database. This issue has been corrected.

Improved performance when creating new connections to Teradata databases.

Corrected an error when connecting to Teradata databases using version 6.2 drivers.

When connected to multidimensional databases, inserting a filter value from a slicing filter (a field that is otherwise not used in the view) into the title or caption would show the field name instead of the field value. This issue has been corrected and the field values are now inserted correctly.

Modified how connections to OData data sources collect metadata if the preferred technique fails. In these cases, Tableau falls back to validating a connection and then loading its metadata, which can be slower than the preferred method.

Connections to OData data sources would only prompt for the Account Key. Tableau will now prompt for username and password when appropriate.

The application would exit unexpectedly when changing the data type for a field in Tableau where the underlying database has also had the datatype changed, making the field invalid. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where Tableau could unexpectedly exit if the datatype of a column used in a MDY calculation changed.

Updated the data used for geocoding zip codes.

Tableau Server
Exporting a PDF would show legends that were hidden when viewed on the server. This issue has been corrected.

Refreshing an extract from a MySQL database would sometimes cause an invalid username and password error. These attributes are now set correctly for both built-in MySQL connections and connections using a generic ODBC driver.

When publishing a workbook using the tabcmd utility, the sheets would be published in alphabetical order instead of the tab order in the workbook. This issue has been corrected and the sheets are now published in the order they are listed in the workbook.

Corrected and issue where parameter controls would not always work the same on Tableau Server as they do in Desktop.

Accessing the default Tableau Server Administrative Views would sometimes cause a server error. This was caused by an issue where there was an interruption retrieving images while loading the workbook.

Added an optional "-n" switch to the tabadmin ziplogs command for collecting netstat information along with the logs.

Corrected several instances where Tableau Server, deployed behind a proxy server, returned pages with the actual hostname in the URL rather than the proxy server name.

The quick filter mode could not be changed between Include and Exclude on Tableau Server. Views were stuck with whatever mode that was published. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where embedded views would intermittently become unresponsive. This issue was caused by a cache timeout that was not being handled properly and therefore preventing other requests.

Corrected a rare case where a VizQL server processing multiple requests at the same time could cause a deadlock state between the requests and become unresponsive.

Corrected a case where the server would become unresponsive and subsequently display "503 could not establish session" and "Internal Server Error" messages.

Filter selections were not being saved with customized views (a change in 6.0.7 caused this). This has been corrected.

Implemented a performance optimization for Tableau Server to not check for page titles and captions when the page shelf is not in use.

Blocked access to some additional URLs on the server that are not part of the product functionality and were identified in an external security review as being inappropriately accessible.

Corrected a case where embedded web pages on a dashboard could display an updated page in response to an action then quickly revert to the prior page.




Version 6.0.7 released May 10, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
When creating a distribution reference line as Percentages of a Constant, there was no way on the dialog to specify the constant value. The dialog box now correctly displays a text box.

Creating a parameter from a calculated field could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit if the parameter was created as a String datatype. This issue has been corrected.

Exporting data to a Microsoft Access database causes an error when one of the exported values exceeds the Access limit of 255 characters per column. This situation is now clearly reported in the error message.

Tableau creates temporary tables when working with certain limits. Corrected an issue where a temporary table would not be dropped at the end of the session if it was created with a single quote character in the name.

Improved the ODBC connection logic to more reliably detect when to re-prompt for username/password rather than prompting to edit the connection definition.

Corrected a case where Tableau could unexpectedly exit when pinning/unpinning items to the start page when using Windows XP or Windows 2003.

Corrected an issue where Tableau could unexpectedly exit when opening the Analysis menu without selecting a view in the dashboard.

Implemented a performance optimization when connecting to multiple tables in an Aster Data database.

Added support for the Progress OpenEdge database server.

Editing permissions for an individual worksheet inside a workbook is now correctly allowed.

Corrected a case where Tableau could unexpectedly exit when adding and removing views and embedded webpages to a dashboard.

Tableau Server
Views with trailing spaces in the name now load correctly when using the Firefox web browser.

Views with empty wild-card quick filters could take an unusually long time to load. These quick filters have been optimized.

Passing parameter values on the URL was not working on dashboards. This issue has been corrected.

Embedded web pages in a dashboard would not update correctly when using a parameter to alter the URL of the embedded page. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where Tableau Server could get 'out of memory' errors and not load workbooks. The root cause was file i/o contention on loading a workbook would cause a high number of retries to open the file, which was consuming memory over time.

When using an external proxy server configured for SSL in front of Tableau Server, the change password and certain permissions pages could not be accessed. These pages can now be accessed as expected.

The +/- drilldown link that appears when hovering the mouse over field headers would sometimes not reappear after it was displayed once. This issue would occur most frequently with dates and has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where the backgrounder process would intermittently stop processing jobs. This issue was caused by a scheduled extract refresh trying to connect to a database with invalid credentials.

Corrected a case where user sessions could get incorrectly reused by multiple machines.

The tabcmd utility would not correctly install on some systems. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where opening a view would cause the error 'An error occurred processing the server response, too much recursion.'

Corrected several instances where Tableau Server deployed behind a proxy server could return pages with the actual hostname in the URL rather than the proxy server name.

Embedded views accessed with trusted ticket authentication when not using unrestricted_ticket would allow access to other server pages beyond just the embedded view. This issue has been corrected.

Export to data now include sub-total and total rows.




Version 6.0.6 released April 6, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
When generating a PDF of a large text view the row headers would sometimes be excluded from the output. This issue has been corrected.

The manual sort and color palette settings are now saved correctly when they are applied to calculated fields that use the values of parameters to select the column to display.

When using user filters, the WHERE clause in queries to the database were generated more complex than was required. These queries have been optimized to once again match what was generated in version 5.2.

Removed the 'Add New Worksheet' tab from Tableau Reader. The tab was inadvertently added to Reader and has now been correctly removed.

Using Show Me! with a column defined as a table calculation could cause the error 'Internal error in file "...\TableCalcInterpreter.c at line 665.' This issue has been corrected.

Implemented a performance optimization when working with quick filters on views that include table calculations.

Parameter controls are now correctly exported to PDF or images when they are included on a dashboard.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when creating a set.

When using calculated fields with case statements, Tableau could create SQL that would cause an Oracle error 'ORA-00907: Missing right parenthesis'. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where adding multiple sheets to a dashboard could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.

Added the ability to pin, unpin, and remove individual workbooks from the start page. Pausing the pointer on the thumbnail of a recently used workbook on the start page now displays a pin/unpin and remove icon. Selecting pin will keep that workbook on the start page always. Unpin will revert back to the normal behavior where the workbook will drop off the page as newer workbooks are opened. Remove will immediately remove the workbook from the start page.

Tableau could unexpectedly exit after clicking the 'Default Table Calculation' option while editing a calculated field. The issue was related to a field that the calculation referenced being removed. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Corrected an issue where exporting data as a CSV file from Tableau Server could cause the data rows to be repeated. This issue would happen when using a single view with multiple panes.

Queries to Teradata that cause the database to run out of spool space could cause the Tableau Server VizQL process to become unresponsive. This error is now handled more gracefully and the process will remain available.

Username links in the Server Activity views (which are really URL actions in the view) would result in a 'page does not exist' error if the username included multiple periods in the name (e.g. fname.lname@yourorg.com).

When using JET-based data sources (Excel, Text files, and Access databases) Tableau Server could return the error 'Could not establish session.' This error was caused by Tableau asking JET for join information that was returning an unexpected null value. This unusual condition is now accounted for and Tableau Server returns the view.

When using an external proxy server configured for SSL in front of Tableau Server, the change password and certain permissions pages could not be accessed. These pages can now be accessed as expected.

Trusted tickets POST in version 6.0.5 was incorrectly requiring &client_ip= to be added. This issue has been corrected, and the &client_ip parameter is no longer required.





Version 6.0.5 released March 8, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Added the ability to select a range of items on a shelf using shift + click. In prior versions, both ctrl-click and shift-click to would add the clicked item to the selection. Tableau now follows the Windows convention of using shift + click to select the range of items between an initial selection and the clicked item.

The data window no longer automatically scrolls the display to the far right to show the trailing characters of long column names. It now keeps the horizontal scroll to the left as the default.

The About screen that shows the Tableau build number now includes the more commonly used three-digit version number as well. For example, the About screen would include the version number 6.0.5. Tableau Server shows this version at the bottom of the sidebar.

Version 5 workbooks that use extracts and a grouping column on data that has a floating point datatype would get the error 'No such function' when opening in version 6. This issue has been corrected.

Altered the way ODBC connect strings are created to avoid the error 'Format of the initialization string does not conform to the OLE DB specification.' This error was typically caused when a OLE DB connect attribute name conflicts with the underlying ODBC driver connect attribute name.

When working with a dual axis chart and trend lines, removing the trend line from one of the axes would then show no text when selecting Describe Trend Model. This issue has been corrected.

Turning off tooltips on multi-value sets now correctly removes the entries from the tooltip.

Implemented a performance optimization for opening workbooks created in v5 with v6. This change affects only certain workbooks.

When connecting to Vertica databases, if the database cannot be reached immediately (due to a network or database issue) Tableau now automatically retries the connection up to four times. Additionally, we have changed the timeout to detect a non-responsive server from a single attempt with a 60 second timeout to the four retries with a 15 second timeout.

Corrected an issue that would occur when connecting to a Teradata database where the width of all rows in a table exceed 64k (32k for Teradata v6 database) which would cause the error "Row size or Sort Key size overflow."

When editing a parameter to change both the name and list of values, the change to values would be applied but not the change to the name. This issue has been corrected and changing them both at one time now works.

When using a Fiscal Year start date other than Jan 1, calculations of Fiscal Quarters in a relative date filter were incorrect. This issue has been corrected.

DateDiff() functions for quarter, month, week could in some cases return values off by one when connecting to GreenPlum, Sybase IQ, ParAccel, or Aster Data databases. The root issue was values truncating rather than rounding for partial periods. The calculations now round partial periods to return the correct results.

Working with a single level cube hierarchy, the compact list filter type was being displayed as a multi-select list (checkboxes) when exporting the view to a PDF.

Corrected a problem when selecting marks with a field on the color shelf where not all the unselected marks would correctly fade their color. The underlying cause was colors whose RGB code is xxFFFF would not get faded correctly.

When a worksheet does not have any measures in play, adding a background image could cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Tooltips for data marks now correctly show labels for Null values.

Importing a bookmark that includes a data source named the same as an existing data source would not overwrite the existing data source, even when the Rename option was selected. This issue has been corrected.

On complex dashboards, right-clicking a mark and selecting Format while other panes on the dashboard are still being updated could cause an error 'Edit interrupted'. This error has been corrected.

Connecting to Text files and changing the character set option to 'Other' would prevent providing a connection name longer than 1 character in the connection dialog box. This issue has been corrected.

Implemented an optimization when connecting to Vertica databases. In prior versions Tableau would detect and log information about Vertica projections. This detection could be time-consuming. This discover is no longer performed.

Implemented an optimization when connecting to Vertica v4.0 or higher databases where we have a more efficient technique to discover available database views.

Implemented an optimization when connecting to Vertica databases. In prior releases Tableau would issue additional metadata discovery queries to test columns to check if they were boolean. This check is now much more selective, and performed only when we see columns defined as char(1).

Implemented a performance optimization when connecting to Vertica databases. Tableau now caches the database locale and does not repeatedly request it from the database.

Extended connections to Vertica databases to support connection customization hints available via TDC files. Details on TDC customizations can be found in the Customizing ODBC Connections article. The customization hints made available for Vertica are: CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES & CAP_SKIP_CONNECT_VALIDATION.

Extended connections to MySQL databases to support connection customization hints available via TDC files. Details on TDC customizations can be found in the Customizing ODBC Connections article. The customization hints available for MySQL are: CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES, CAP_SELECT_INTO, CAP_SELECT_INTO & CAP_QUERY_HAVING_REQUIRES_GROUP_BY (for InfoBright users).

Corrected an issue when connecting to Teradata databases where selecting a table with referential integrity constraints could cause an error. The error would have included the text 'Blank name in quotation marks.'

Corrected an issue with creating temporary tables when connected to Teradata databases. Tableau was incorrectly using != as a test of inequality rather than the Teradata syntax of <>.

Extended connections to Teradata databases to support connection customization hints available via TDC files. Details on TDC customizations can be found in the Customizing ODBC Connections article. The customization hints made available for Teradata are: CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES & CAP_SKIP_CONNECT_VALIDATION.

On dashboards that connect to multiple data sources, adding a highlight action would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Entering a value and then pressing enter into a custom value list quick filter could generate an error "An unexpected error occurred on the server. If you continue to receive this error please contact your Tableau Server Administrator. Would you like to reset the view?" Entering values into these lists now require you to press the plus icon (+) to add the value.

User and group names that match the search engine 'exclude' terms were not appearing in the lists of users/groups in the server interface. The initial report was for groups named IS and IT. The following words are now valid as user and group names: a an and are as at be but by for if in into is it no not of on or s such t that the their then there these they this to.

Substitution values for embedded web pages on a dashboard now correctly substitute Full Name, User Name, Sheet Name, and Workbook names.

Selecting Revert All from the toolbar now reverts any highlighting of marks that were triggered by a highlight action.

Optimized how backups are created when using the tabadmin backup command and cut the time to create the backup file significantly. This same optimization helps with the automatic backup that is performed when uninstalling Tableau Server prior to upgrading.

Corrected an issue publishing workbooks that use the username() function for defining user filters. The error message you would see prior this change was 'Cannot evaluate user filter; no current user or group.'

Removing saved views (views saved be selecting 'Remember My Changes') would not actually remove the saved view on all browsers. This issue has been corrected.

Quick filters displayed with the 'All' option could get into an unusual state where deselecting 'All' would leave all the individual items checked. This issue has been corrected.

The Export Data permission was incorrectly blocking the ability to create a PDF. This issue has been corrected.

When connected to an Analysis Services cube data source, selecting the first item in a compact list quick filter was not applying the filter. This issue has been corrected.

Working with trusted tickets for authentication, when a view is accessed from a shared computer by an unlicensed user, any next valid user from the same machine would not be properly authenticated. This issue has been corrected.

When working with trusted tickets for authentication, an unlicensed user would incorrectly be returned a view when requesting it.

When working with Microsoft Analysis Services, using the download data option from the Server would duplicate all dimension columns in the resulting file. This issue has been corrected.




Version 6.0.4 released February 1, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Improved the experience when working with multiple connections in a workbook that point to the same extract file. When duplicating a connection that uses an extract we now also make a copy of the extract. For workbooks that are upgraded from prior versions we now ensure the multiple connections are aware that the extract may have already been upgraded.

Added support for working with Excel files where the column heading names have leading or trailing spaces as part of the name. The extra spaces are now ignored by Tableau. Previously when a column had a leading or trailing space it would get the error 'Database error 0x80040E10: No value given for one or more required parameters."

When a sheet on a dashboard becomes invalid, usually because a field on the sheet becomes invalid, the Title of the sheet would show as blank and the 'go to' button would look active but not take you to the sheet. The title now appears and the 'go to' button is now active.

The option to synchronize axes when the values on the axes are different datatypes has been disabled. Prior to this change the menu was available but did nothing when selected. To synchronize axes, they need to have the same datatype.

Corrected an issue when creating a Tableau Extract where the error 'Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: HashGrouping::InsertHash: collisions = ..." could be encountered.

Corrected an issue when using JET-based connections (Excel, text files, Access databases) that would cause the error: 'Microsoft JET database error 0x80040E14: Join expression not supported. Unable to calculate the sort for the field . The display may not show correct data.'

Implemented a performance optimization where we no longer query for the full list of possible values when a quick filter is set to be a wildcard filter. For very large databases this unnecessary query could be very time consuming.

Implemented a performance optimization when working with a Tableau Extract and the Total() table calculation.

Corrected a case where opening a workbook with a very large number of worksheets (over 250 worksheets) would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. The application was running out of Windows resources with this many worksheets.

Iteratively selecting marks and excluding them when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube was not keeping the 'prior' excludes. This behavior has been corrected.

Corrected the SQL generated when using grouping columns so it no longer creates needlessly long running queries compared to prior versions of Tableau.

Tableau no longer unexpectedly exits when opening certain bookmark files that reference Tableau extracts.

Optimized performance by using more efficient database queries when using relative date filters.

When connected to a Tableau Extract, changing the datatype of a field from 'string' to 'date' now correctly converts the dates.

For fields that have exclude filters defined, right-clicking a label and selecting 'Keep Only' would incorrectly exclude the selection. The selections are now correctly kept in the view and all others are excluded.

Corrected an issue where a filter action could inadvertently change the filter type on other quick filters (e.g., change the filter type from multiple value list to custom value list).

Removed the dialog box that stated 'The connection to the database was successful.' when creating a new connection. Removing this dialog box make the connection process more efficient by eliminating the extra click required to dismiss it.

Added a new tab located on the right side of the worksheet tabs along the bottom of the workbook. Clicking this tab that will create a new worksheet.

Made resizing and moving panes on a dashboard easier. An active pane on a dashboard can now be resized vertically by clicking and dragging on the top blue header area. Prior releases required a more precise click on the area just above the blue header. The expanded area for clicking makes resizing easier. To move the dashboard zone you now drag it by selecting the 'gripper' in the middle of the header area.

When connecting to a cube data source (Analysis Services or Essbase), calculations using local functions such as USERDOMAIN() AND USERNAME() to get values from a Tableau Server connection would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Using the DATEDIFF() function to calculate the difference in number of Quarters when using a Tableau Extract was incorrect.

When running Tableau on Windows XP and connecting to Teradata databases, table names longer than 30 characters could not be seen. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau now correctly geocodes the 'Australian Capital Territory' when creating a map.

Tableau Server
On Tableau Servers with multiple machines in the configuration (i.e., you have Worker machines as part of your deployment) processing scheduled tasks are now distributed across all nodes that have a VizQL server process running on them. In many scenarios this change can help with overall throughput of the schedule.

Images on the toolbar could have extra pixel artifacts around them when viewed with a browser zoom larger than 100%, which occurs most frequently when using Safari on the iPad.

Selection and highlighting has been added to the state saved by Remember My Changes. Additionally, these features are restored to the view's initial state when selecting Original View.

Relative date quick filters displayed in the Browse Period mode, would show white borders around the options when placed on a non-white background. These extra borders have been removed.

Using the 'download' link for an embedded view that is served from an SSL-enabled Tableau Server would generate an error. This issue has been corrected.

Worksheets with Unicode characters in the name now correctly display the Share and Download links when viewed on Tableau Server.

Corrected a problem that was displaying the error message: 'Could not find FieldNameIdentifier for ""." This problem was related to legends (color or size) being removed from dashboards.

When viewing a customized view (saved by Remember My Changes), removing that customized view now returns you to the original view rather than remaining on the customized version.

Corrected an issue when URL parameters are passed and the next request includes either malformed parameters or does not include any URL parameters the server could become unresponsive or incorrectly return the previous view.

When using a slider quick filter, the display format of the values shown on the slider was not correctly showing negative numbers. For example entering -365 would correctly set the filter to -365, but the value display on the slider control was losing the negative sign. These values are now displayed correctly.

The slider on the Page control had a white border around it when displayed on a dashboard with a non-white background. This issue has been corrected and the region around the slider is drawn as transparent so the background color displays properly.

Removing the title on the Page card would result in the Page card not appearing on the dashboard when it was published to Tableau Server. This issue has been corrected.

When using a Tableau Server configured for trusted authentication, displaying a tabbed workbook now correctly allows navigation between the tabs. Prior to this correction it would incorrectly display the message, 'Your session has expired. Do you want to login again?'

The command, 'tabcmd syncgroup', was incorrectly reporting the status of unsuccessful syncs as successful. This command now correctly reports success and failure.

When using tabcmd to retrieve pdf or png versions of a view, any user filters defined in the view were not correctly applied. The user filters worked fine when accessing the view via the Tableau Server interface, but not when using tabcmd. This issue has been corrected.

Actions that are defined to appear in the tooltip menu would not always appear. The tooltip menu was suppressed from displaying when the full text of the item is visible on screen and the tooltip would have simply repeated that text. The tooltip now appears in this case when there are Actions defined.

Pasting values from the clipboard into a custom value list quick filter would not work when using an Internet Explorer browser. These quick filters now behave correctly.

Running the command, 'tabadmin backup,' on a server with the extract engine distributed onto a second machine would not properly include the extract data in the backup. This issue has been corrected.

The web interface for changing permissions would fail on servers configured to use SSL because it was not using HTTPS on the request. This issue has been corrected.

The embed code generated by the Share button now correctly generates codes for views accessed when using trusted ticket authentication.

Corrected an issue where publishing a view with certain quick filters could cause an error. The error message is: 'Unexpected Server Error. This view cannot display because the domain for one of the filters could not be identified.'

URLs generated that include field names now encode the bracket [] characters.

Using the Data Connections page to update the attributes of a connection (for example to change the database server name) would not properly update TWBX files. Updating would cause the error, 'Uncaught error: An unexpected error occurred opening the packaged workbook.' This issue has been corrected.

Corrected one cause of the error 'Session Ended by Server: An unexpected error occurred on the server...'. This correction is related to using Keep Only on certain views where the data column in the view may have changed on the database.

Remember My Changes now remembers the values of parameters.

Remember My Changes now remembers the values of filters set by actions.

When using trusted authentication between a web application and Tableau Server, redeeming a second trusted ticket from the same machine would not fully reset the session for the second ticket, which could cause incorrect reuse of cached data, views, or filters.



Version 6.0.3 released December 22, 2010.
This release is an emergency update to address a product issue that affected Tableau Server Version 6. It does not affect Tableau Desktop.

Tableau Server would display an error message "This interim release of Tableau has expired." This message was caused by an expiration policy that was not correctly removed from Tableau Server 6.0.0, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2. Tableau products that are built before our final releases (beta and test versions) have a 45-day expiration policy built into the code. An expired version of Tableau Server would prevent new content from being published, scheduled extracts will not refresh, and downloading workbooks will not succeed. Any existing workbooks already published would continue to be accessible. This issue has been corrected and the expiration policy has been removed.

Tableau Server 6.0.3 is the same product at 6.0.2 with the expiration issue corrected. There are no other changes in this release. Tableau Desktop is not affected. Your existing 6.0.0, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2 Desktop products will continue to work with the 6.0.3 Server.



Version 6.0.2 released December 15, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Selecting Export > Data when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube database could export duplicate columns of data. This issue has been corrected.

The View Data command now correctly displays results when a pie chart has no fields on both the Row and Column shelves.

When using table calculations, exporting to crosstab or duplicating a sheet as a crosstab could result in a crosstab with 100% in all cells. The problem occurs when fields are used on the color or size shelf that would be auto-added to the crosstab.

Tooltips for wide entries in the color legend would sometimes block the ability to select the entry and enable highlighting. The click now correctly passes through the tooltip to select the entry in the color legend.

The plus and minus (+/-) indicators for drilling up and down dates and hierarchies would not be active when field labels for rows were hidden. The +/- indicators have been moved to display in the top row of data when the field labels are hidden.

Dashboards where the Use as Filter option is set so one sheet filters the others would not always remember the state of the filter when the workbook is first opened. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue when clicking the undo button after grouping members together would sometimes cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when you add views to a dashboard that all use the same data source but different filters.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit if a field on the Level of Detail shelf is filtered and ends up with no rows.

Corrected an issue where changing a compact quick filter from Show All Values to Show Fewer Values could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

Hidden fields were appearing in the automatic data relationships dialog box. This issue has been corrected and the hidden fields are no longer included in the relationship dialog.

Tableau Reader was allowing dashboard zones to be closed. It should not have allowed this.

Tableau Reader was displaying the 'Go to Sheet' button in a dashboard zone title, which could be used to go to a hidden sheet. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem that was causing a particular large workbook to not be able to open. The workbook had over 30 views in it, all arranged on a set of dashboards.

Tableau could unexpectedly exit when connecting to an OData data source and the number of columns returned changes mid-way through the connection. If additional columns start appearing mid-retrieval from an OData data source they are now ignored.

Synchronizing dual axis charts when the axis is using a logarithmic scale now works correctly.

When you add multiple sheets that use the Pages shelf to a dashboard, then remove the fields from the Pages shelves the application could unexpectedly exit when you switch back to the dashboard, select the now empty page control on the dashboard and select Synchronize. This issue has been corrected.

When working with an existing sheet that has data blended from multiple data sources, selecting 'Show Me' could in certain cases cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

The lower part of descenders on text characters (like the bottom of the letter g) are now no longer clipped by a pixel when publishing a view to a PDF file.

Custom Value List filters and Wildcard match filters now work correctly when the search string includes apostrophes (e.g., O'Leary).

Context menu items for Create Primary Group and Edit Primary Aliases were incorrectly available when working with a multidimensional (cube) data source. Selecting these options would cause an error. These menu items are now hidden for cube sources.

Corrected an issue that was displaying the error 'Invalid datetime value' when opening a particular version 5 workbook with version 6.

When using Analysis Services databases, adding trend lines for a categorical axis, extending the axis range to project further to the right would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This has been corrected and trend lines for cubes can be projected to future periods.

Implemented a number of changes to the memory utilization checks, which were over aggressively reporting low memory conditions. These checks are now more accurate and will reduce the frequency of false-positive warnings about low memory.

A calculation built from two table calculations now correctly honors the 'running' direction for the resulting calculation.

Using parameters in custom formulas in the filter dialog (for example to use a parameter to control the number of Top N items to display) could cause the filter to not be recognized as valid when opening the saved workbook. This issue has been corrected.

Implemented an optimization for Vertica v4 connections where the way Tableau creates temporary tables includes "unsegmented all nodes" on the temporary table definition, which results in the temporary table being available on every node in a Vertica cluster.

Refreshing an extract now also optimizes the extract.

Implemented a performance optimization when working with Tableau Extracts and performing exclude filters.

Corrected a case when using the data blending feature where Tableau could unexpectedly quit when running low on system memory.

Using an advanced Table Calculation function could cause the application to unexpectedly exit when toggling the options to Show Mark Labels.

Corrected a problem where refreshing an extract after the underlying database schema has changed would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.

In certain cases the last pixel of certain annotations could get clipped. This issue has been corrected.

When working on a non-English operating system and working with double-byte data, certain text characters would cause the application to unexpectedly exit when there were hyphenated words in the display (e.g., in annotation and captions).

When working with an OData data source, the data in the workbook could not be refreshed to access updated data from the OData feed if some of the columns in the data window were hidden. This issue has been corrected.

Parameter controls are now correctly displayed when the sheet or dashboard is published to a PDF file.

When a workbook is first saved on a machine where the operating system is using a locale that supports extended character sets (such as special accent marks) and then opened on a machine using a different locale that doesn't support those same extended character sets, the application would unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected and the workbook can be opened using any locale (although the extended characters may not display correctly).

Implemented a number of performance optimizations in the Tableau extract files.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when combining multiple sheets that use a cube data source onto a dashboard and turning on the 'Use as Filter' option.

Quick filters set to a Custom Value List would not get any formatting changes cleared when selecting the Clear button from the bottom of the Format window. This issue has been corrected.

In Tableau Reader, the F10 key now correctly toggles the pause/resume automatic updates command.

Corrected a case where an 'Unhandled Exception' error was displayed when publishing a particular workbook to Tableau Server.

Corrected a case where publishing a workbook to Tableau Server that contains a quick filter with several hundred thousand items in the list would cause a C++ runtime error.

Corrected a problem when using version 6.0 to open a workbook created with v5. The message displayed was: 'Tableau Data Engine Error: 4: No such function (iif boolean string integer).' These workbooks now open correctly.

Corrected a case where synchronized page cards on a dashboard could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

Creating two parameters and naming them both the identical name which includes a blank space as the last character (for example: 'mango ') would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit.

Quick filters on columns whose names include square brackets [] would cause an error. This issue has been corrected.

Calculated field that use the IIF function to compare a string column where the first few characters of the comparison were actually numbers could perform incorrect comparisons. This issue has been corrected.

DATETIME columns now work correctly when using them for data blending.

Corrected an "Unhandled Exception" that occurred after first editing a data connection and then renaming a field.

Hiding a row with all NULL values would also incorrectly hide the grand totals row.

Tableau Server
Search strings on the users and groups administrative pages now have an implicit asterisk wildcard character (*) automatically added to the end of non-quoted search strings. This provides for a more expected set of search results. For example, searching for Pat will now search for Pat*, while a search for "Pat" will be restrictive and search for only the three letter match.

'Save My Changes' to create customized views of a dashboard could cause the browser to become unresponsive if the some of the sheets in the original workbook are renamed and then republished. This non-responsiveness has been corrected.

Tableau Server type-in parameters were not auto-completing when you've typed in a unique prefix to one entry. Auto-completion has been implemented now. For example, in a list of U.S. State names, typing Ari will auto-complete the entry with Arizona.

In the Tableau Desktop dialog box for importing workbooks or data sources from the server, optimized how lists of items are returned from the server.

When using the 'By Publisher,' 'By Project,' and other 'By ...' links to filter lists of workbooks or views, the Quick Filter page lists the names of the Publishers, Projects, etc. and in parenthesis the number of related items. The page was incorrectly showing the complete number of workbooks in the group regardless of permissions. This number now correctly reflects the number of items you have permission to access rather than the total number.

Embed codes created on the Share dialog when invoked from something other than the first tab in a tabbed workbook view could embed the first tab rather than the active tab.

Corrected a case where Tableau Server would return the error: "private method 'split' called for nil:NilClass."

Corrected a problem using the type-in search filter when accessing the server from Safari on an iPad.

Corrected a problem that required clicking twice on menus and quick filters when accessing the server from Safari on an iPad.

Corrected a display problem on type-in filters when accessing the server using Safari on an iPad.

Tableau Server could go unresponsive when multiple sessions were accessing the same database connection that is using the 'Other Databases (ODBC)' connection type.

Corrected a problem where Tableau Server would get an error when displaying a view. The error message was: syntax error on line 30, col -1: `</p>. This error has been corrected and the views now open correctly.

Searching for data sources by Tag now works.

Filters and quick filters when using JET-based connections (Excel, Access, Text files) could display duplicate entries in the list of available values. This issue has been corrected.

Several updates to the tabcmd documentation.

Tooltips would not display for workbooks that were created and published with version 5. This issue has been corrected. Make sure to clear the browser cache to see this correction.

Corrected an issue where a Tableau Server process would become unresponsive and cause a users' session to time out. When the browser is refreshed, the user could incorrectly pick up another user's session.

Added the ability for an administrator to rename a group and successfully synchronize with Active Directory groups that have been renamed. When the AD group name changes, edit the group on the Administrator > Groups page on Tableau Server and then synchronize the group.



Version 6.0.1 released November 18, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Tableau extract files with certain filter conditions could have problems and freeze during migration when moving to the new data engine format.

Tableau Server
Corrected an issue where the Tableau Server data cache was not being hit as frequently as it was in v5.2 causing a performance impact.

Saving workbooks to Tableau Public would always display tabbed workbook views, regardless of the option specified at save time. This has been corrected.



Version 6.0 released November 10, 2010.
Tableau 6.0 includes more than 60 new features. We're introducing a fast data engine so in addition to live data connections you can now load data into the data engine to speed it up and take load off critical systems. We've also added data blending so you can layer data from two sources in the same view. Combination charts, page trails, powerful new table calculations, parameters, are all just the beginning of what's new in this version.

See what's new in Tableau 6.0 +

Supported platform changes in v6: With the release of Tableau version 6, support for Windows 2000 has be discontinued for Tableau Desktop. Tableau Server has discontinued support for Internet Explorer 6 as a browser.



Version 5.2.9 released June 23, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a case where Tableau could unexpectedly exit if the datatype of a column used in a MDY calculation changed.

Updated the data used for geocoding zip codes.



Version 5.2.8 released March 7, 2011.
Tableau Server
Working with trusted tickets for authentication, when a view is accessed from a shared computer by an unlicensed user, any next valid user from the same machine would not be properly authenticated. This issue has been corrected.

When working with trusted tickets for authentication, an unlicensed user would incorrectly be returned a view when requesting it.

When working with Microsoft Analysis Services, using the download data option from the Server would duplicate all dimension columns in the resulting file. This issue has been corrected.


Version 5.2.7 released February 1, 2011.
Tableau Desktop
When running Tableau on Windows XP and connecting to Teradata databases, table names longer than 30 characters could not be seen. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau now correctly geocodes the 'Australian Capital Territory' when creating a map.

Tableau Server
When using trusted authentication between a web application and Tableau Server, redeeming a second trusted ticket from the same machine would not fully reset the session for the second ticket, which could cause incorrect reuse of cached data, views, or filters.



Version 5.2.6 released December 15, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Hiding a row with all NULL values would also incorrectly hide the grand totals row.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when combining multiple sheets that use a cube data source onto a dashboard and turning on the 'Use as Filter' option.

Tableau Server
Corrected an issue where a Tableau Server process would become unresponsive and cause a users' session to time out. When the browser is refreshed, the user could incorrectly pick up another user's session.


Version 5.2.5 released November 10, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Using Analysis Services cubes when drilling down on individual members in a hierarchy (asymmetric drill-down), Tableau action filters would not always apply the selected level as the filter. This has been corrected.

Added support for the Windows Azure Marketplace DataMarket as a data source. This was previously called the Microsoft Codename "Dallas" data source.

Changing a filter on a measure would in some cases not immediately update the subtotal and grand totals. This has been corrected.

Stopped excluding Oracle table names that have a forward slash (/) in the name from the list of available tables when creating a connection.

Tableau Server
Corrected a case where "An unexpected error occurred on the server." message could be encountered when pressing the Revert All button on the toolbar after working with views defined as filters on a dashboard.

Corrected a case where a Quick Filter with no values available (i.e., the quick filter gets a null list of available options) would cause the error "Internal error in file ..\src\server\ServerFilter.cpp at line 548."

Corrected a case where a workbook created in v5.1 opened in v5.2 would generate the error 'Internal error in file "core/ReferenceCount.h" at line 109.'. This was caused by a particular column being used as a categorical filter.

Corrected a problem that was causing IE6 and Firefox 3.6 browser to display the SSL mixed-mode warning message.


Version 5.2.4 released October 6, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a problem that could cause a Runtime Error when saving a workbook with multiple instances of Tableau Desktop open at the same time.

Corrected an issue that was preventing connections to a Progress database using the "Other Database (ODBC)" connection type.

Implemented a number of improvements when using the "Other Database (ODBC)" connection to access a SQLite database. Due to limitations in the ODBC driver for SQLite full Tableau capabilities will not be possible, but the improvements added will allow creating Tableau extracts from SQLite databases.

Corrected a problem that could result in a database error "...a GROUP BY clause is required before HAVING". The issue was the SQL Tableau generates in some scenarios would include a HAVING clause without a GROUP BY clause. While valid per the SQL specification, InfoBright and SQLite databases do not accept these statements.

When using the "Other Database (ODBC)" connection, the syntax used to query for Day dateparts was changed to be more compatible with a number of databases.

When using the "Other Database (ODBC)" connection, details of the connection such as the schema to connect to are not remembered after entering a bad password. When the connection is retried after providing a new password the connection details are now remembered correctly.

When using the "Other Databases (ODBC)" connection, Tableau now ignores the space character as an identifier quote character, which a number of drivers, including the SAS driver, report back to us. The space character is an invalid character to use for quoting identifiers, but some drivers report it rather than a null character.

Corrected a problem creating large extracts from Postgres or Greenplum databases. The error message displayed was "Database error: the database query failed to return a rowset." The error was triggered by running out of memory on the server while assembling the data. Tableau now requests the data to be streamed as it is assembled rather than completely collected on the database before returning the results.

Adding a new zone to a dashboard that already has a number of other zones could cause the application to freeze. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Drilling down on dimensions in dashboards that connect to Microsoft Analysis Services or Essbase databases and use action filters would sometimes cause the image tiles for other sheets to display incorrectly. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where creating extracts with relative date filters were not including the relative aspect of the filter. The most common scenario was workbooks published to Tableau Server with relative dates would not get the date filter updated.

Corrected a problem with the display of color legends when using Safari on a Macintosh.

Corrected a number of cases where the URL parameter "embed=yes" was not being preserved when moving between pages or after session timeouts.


Version 5.2.3 released September 8, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Dashboard quick filters and legends now use the Default Worksheet font (Format > Font). This change is particularly useful for Asian languages where the filters and legends were not being drawn in unicode-aware fonts.

Made several corrections to built-in maps and geocoding. Specifically, the label for the Vatican no longer obscures the label for Rome, the Fijian political divisions correctly label Northern and Western Fiji, zip codes in Illinois and New York display in the correct locations, Washington DC borders are drawn correctly, and an additional level of detail was added to the United Kingdom map.

Corrected an issue where custom shapes wouldn't display when a workbook is first opened.

Menu options now behave correctly after creating an extract from a Custom SQL connection.

Turning on highlighting would sometimes cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

Modified ODBC connections to respect either DRIVER or DSN parameters in the connection string. Previously, only the first parameter would be considered.

Using ODBC connections to connect to multiple tables would sometimes cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

When connected to a PostgreSQL database, including fields values in titles would sometimes generate a query that would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to multidimensional data sources (cubes), categorical filters would sometimes cause a "Couldn't find a key during dictionary lookup" error. More logging has been added to handle this error.

Tableau Server
Dashboards that have quick filters with scroll bars would not display correctly in all web browsers. Specifically, the quick filters would display horizontally and the scroll bars would be missing. The scroll bars now display correctly. However, if the quick filter is too short to fit a vertical scroll bar it will still switch to a horizontal orientation when published.

URL links would not always show in tooltips when you first selected one or more marks in the published view. Tooltips now correctly show link actions without requiring a second click.

Corrected an error that would occur when creating a scheduled extract of data with double-byte language data (e.g., Chinese) into a SQL Server database.


Version 5.2.2 released August 3, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
ODBC connections that generate driver capability warnings while connecting now have the "Do not show again" option for the specific ODBC driver name. This change allows you to bypass this warning dialog for some connections and retain it for others.

When connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database, adding calculated measures could temporarily sort the measures list in an unusual order. Closing and reopening the workbook would then sort them correctly. The calculated measures are now correctly presented in the list immediately after creating them.

Workbooks with multiple sheets connecting to Vertica databases would prompt multiple times to connect to the database, once for each worksheet. Tableau now correctly prompts once for each connection.

Corrected a case where Tableau could unexpectedly exit when setting a quick filter selection to a value that returns no values from the query.

Columns defined as the datatype VarBinary in MySQL databases could incorrectly combine values into a single mark in Tableau. For example, aa, aA, and AA would all be incorrectly combined into a single mark. Tableau now correctly manages the collation for VarBinary columns.

Using the Export > Data menu command when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube databases could export duplicate columns of data. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a sorting issue when using Microsoft data sources and columns that contain text with apostrophes and hyphens.

When printing, if the selected printer is unavailable or unreachable for some reason Tableau could unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected and a message now appears stating Tableau is unable to print to the device.

Corrected a problem when publishing workbooks to a Tableau Server that is running on a port other than 80. The second time you publish from the same desktop session Tableau Desktop would unexpectedly exit.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when printing a dashboard with the copyright symbol used in a text object.

Tableau Server
Changed the default setting for trusted ticket relationships between external application servers and Tableau Server. The old default required that the IP address of the ticket redemption matched the IP address of the original POST. This check would fail in many scenarios where firewall and proxy server configurations would re-map the true client IP address. The new default is to only match on the request coming from a trusted host. Only the configuration setting default value has been changed. Customers that wish to enforce client IP matching can change the default using the tabadmin utility.

Corrected an issue when using a Firefox browser to access a Tableau Server behind certain reverse proxies configurations where changing a quick filters would return the error "The server could not respond due to a malformed request."

Quick filters for measures displayed on Tableau Server where the lower or upper bounds were set to zero would not correctly display the slider ends. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where configuring a Tableau Server to hide the Share button on embedded views (by using the command: tabadmin set vizqlserver.showshare false) was not actually suppressing the Share button.

Fixed an issue that was causing "No license found; Session creation failed." errors from Tableau Server.



Version 5.2.1 released July 7, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
The application no longer unexpectedly exits when importing custom geocoding that uses the same field names as the built-in geocoding data but has a different hierarchy. For example, importing data with a hierarchy of State then Country instead of Country, State.

Corrected some map drawing in the area around Sydney Harbor.

The Clear Filters menu command for multi-select quick filters now correctly activates on the Clear toolbar button drop-down menu.

Updated the Microsoft PowerPivot connection dialog to clarify how to enter connect strings. Additionally, updated a number of error messages related to PowerPivot to be more understandable.

Changed the default map options so that the Place Names option is off. Place Names include city names, neighborhood names, and points of interest names.

Corrected an issue with geocoding not handling names with accent characters, such as Québec. All names are now matched on the ASCII spelling of the name, which omits the accent characters.

Canadian state abbreviations were missing from the automatic geocoding. This data has been re-added to the product.

When connecting to Microsoft PowerPivot, browsing the SharePoint server to locate content now includes the root level of the SharePoint site in the browse dialog.

Tableau Server
Servers that have Guest access enabled now correctly redirect to a the normal login page instead of a permission denied page when you access a direct URL link to a view that does not allow the Guest user to see it.


Version 5.2 released June 15, 2010.
In Tableau 5.2, weÃŒve added native connectivity for four data sources and provided support for hundreds of other connections with an ODBC connector. We've also updated the default map style with new font treatments and subtle changes to the colors used for water, land, parks and urban areas. As an alternative to the default maps, Tableau 5.2 has a second map style. Finally, the new maps include increased depth coverage for zooming into all parts of the world.

See what's new in Tableau 5.2 +

Below is a more detailed list of corrections in Tableau 5.2.

Tableau Desktop
When importing custom geocoding values, Tableau now automatically treats all integer values as dimensions for the geocoding data. This treatment it easier to use custom geocoding files that include values such as Store_ID for the unique identifier.

The data layer on the Map Options card has been renamed from CMSA to CBSA. CMSA is the Core Metropolitan Statistical Area, which was replaced in 2003 by the CBSA, which is the Core Based Statistical Area. The data points and map boundary & labels were always CBSA data. Tableau originally named the data layer incorrectly.

Along with the updates to the map visual styles, the built-in geocoding data has been updated to correct a number of problems with incorrect placement of some zip codes, area codes, and country names.

Optimized performance when connecting to Netezza databases, specifically related to sending metadata queries that include a "limit 1" in the SQL. These queries now use "limit 0" for these metadata discovery queries.

Added an option to "Remove Reference Line" to the context menu (right-click) menu for an axis that has one or more references lines.

Corrected a query error that occurred when using Essbase utility dimensions and continuous dates.

Corrected an issue where editing the connection for multiple joined text files could inadvertently remove the joined files from the definition.

Running the Tableau installer to repair an installation was not correctly associating the file associations with the 'repaired' version. The repair function in the installer now correctly assigned filetypes to open with the correct version of Tableau.

Bar charts drawn with negative values that extend either to the left or below the 0 line would sometimes have a small 1 pixel gap between the 0 line and the start of the bar. This drawing error has been corrected.

Corrected an issue when using Tableau date functions and WEEK with Teradata databases.

When using the zoom toolbar option, clicking one of the zoom levels in the drop-down control would zoom to an incorrect level. Clicking on a specific step now zooms to that correct level.

Corrected an problem when connecting to a Navteq WMS server.

Tableau Server
A Tableau Server installed behind a reverse proxy now correctly accesses the pages to set permissions on a workbook.

If publishing a workbook to Tableau Server fails it could leave partial workbook fragments on the server, which would appear in the list of workbooks but not open correctly. Tableau Server now ensures the workbook publishes correctly before making any of the views available in the workbook list.

On a dashboard with embedded web content, a filter action that targets a different view or dashboard in the workbook would not correctly open in a new window. Rather it would load the target view into the existing web container on the original dashboard. These actions now open the target view in a new window as expected.

A confusing and inaccurate message was returned to people without an active account (an unlicensed user) on Tableau Server The message has been updated to be more relevant and understandable.


Version 5.1.8 released November 10, 2010
Tableau Desktop
Optimized performance for relative date quick filters when using the 'All Values in Database' setting (as opposed to using the "Only Relevant Values' option).

Tableau Server
Corrected an inconsistency between Desktop and Server for the behavior of compact list quick filters. The inconsistency occurred when using Action Filters to guide selections between sheets on a dashboard. On Tableau Server, the first item in the compact list quick filter was being selected after an action filter was triggered, while on Desktop the first item was not automatically selected. Tableau Server has been changed to match the desktop behavior.



Version 5.1.7 released September 8, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
When connected to a PostgreSQL database, including fields values in titles would sometimes generate a query that would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

When connecting to multidimensional data sources (cubes), categorical filters would sometimes cause a "Couldn't find a key during dictionary lookup" error. More logging has been added to handle this error.

Updated the built-in maps to show the correct Washington DC borders.

Tableau Server
URL links would not always show in tooltips when you first selected one or more marks in the published view. Tooltips now correctly show link actions without requiring a second click.

Corrected an error that would occur when creating a scheduled extract of data with double-byte language data (e.g., Chinese) into a SQL Server database.



Version 5.1.6 released August 3, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Columns defined as the datatype VarBinary in MySQL databases could incorrectly combine values into a single mark in Tableau. For example, aa, aA, and AA would all be incorrectly combined into a single mark. Tableau now correctly manages the collation for VarBinary columns.

Using the Export > Data menu command when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube databases could export duplicate columns of data. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a sorting issue when using Microsoft data sources and columns that contain text with apostrophes and hyphens.

When printing, if the selected printer is unavailable or unreachable for some reason Tableau could unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected and a message now appears stating Tableau is unable to print to the device.

Corrected a problem when publishing workbooks to a Tableau Server that is running on a port other than 80. The second time you publish from the same desktop session Tableau Desktop would unexpectedly exit.

Corrected a case where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when printing a dashboard with the copyright symbol used in a text object.

Tableau Server
Fixed an issue that was causing "No license found; Session creation failed." errors from Tableau Server.


Version 5.1.5 released July 7, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected an issue where the application could unexpectedly exit when connected to Teradata and using DATEPART functions in quick filters.

Reference lines formatting created in Version 5.0 can now be changed in version 5.1 workbooks.

Duplicate columns could appear in certain situations in the View Data dialog when connected to Microsoft Analysis Services. This has been corrected.

Optimized performance for relative date filters when using the "last n periods" option (for example "Last 12 months").

Tableau Server
Corrected an error that would occur when creating a scheduled extract of data with double-byte language data (e.g., Chinese) into a SQL Server database.

Corrected a case where a "Session Busy" error was being returned to the browser incorrectly. The underlying cause was a tooltip being requested before the view was completely loaded, which could be caused by the placement of the mouse pointer while the view is loading. This case is now accounted for and the busy error is not triggered.



Version 5.1.4 released June 15, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Added an option to cancel when opening a file from a networked file server that is taking a long time to respond.

Using Grand Totals and manually sorting dimensions when connected to an Analysis Services cube would cause an error "Couldn't find a key during dictionary lookup." This has been corrected.

Corrected the following error that could occur when connecting to Essbase 7 databases: "Error: Essbase database error 1260046: Unknown Member MEMNOR used in query."

Closing old data connections and deleting the associated worksheets would sometimes cause the application to exit. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a case where adding filters to a workbook that was created in version 5.0 of Tableau would cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

Corrected a case where pattern match filters could needlessly run queries to collect the set of possible values for the filter, which could be very slow. Tableau no longer runs these unnecessary queries in these cases.

Tableau Server
Using the tabcmd utility to publish workbooks with hidden worksheets would publish the hidden sheets as visible. This has been corrected so that hidden sheets are indeed hidden.

Corrected an issue where following a filter action on selection to move between sheets would cause Tableau Server to display the error: "The destination sheet [Dashboard Name] does not exist in this workbook." This error would occur because another quick filter removed the values that are part of the active selection.

Export data to crosstab would in some cases misalign column headers in the resulting export file. This has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where filter actions that target a subset of the views on a dashboard would sometimes apply the filter to all the views.

Optimized performance when loading views and dashboards that include quick filters that use the wildcard filter mode. This change will be most noticeable when the underlying column the quick filter is based on includes a very large number of values.

Implemented a performance optimization for displaying and scrolling in very large crosstabs.

Corrected an issue that was preventing scheduled extracts on Tableau Server from having their schedule removed.

Changing your password for Tableau Server accounts when the server is running with SSL would fail and the password would not be changed. This issue has been corrected.


Version 5.1.3 released May 6, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a problem displaying quick filters for data stored in a MySQL column defined with a enum datatype.

Added the ability to direct temporary files created by Tableau to point to a specific directory (or drive) by setting the environment variable TABLEAUTEMP.

A new option to "Ignore in Table Calculations" has been added to the context menu for discrete measures, which allows you to add table calculations to the continuous measures in the view.

Fixed a problem where the application would unexpectedly exit when creating reference lines that are scoped to the cell and include the Total function.

The function ATAN2 is not supported on Jet-based data sources (Excel, Access, text files) and using it causes query errors. This function has been removed from the available functions list for these connections.

Corrected an issue when connecting to an Access database where integer columns could not display correctly when the sum of the field expands beyond the defined column width.

Corrected a case where the Percent of Total table calculation could cause the error, "Cannot find a total needed to compute a percentage", after drilling down in the cube hierarchy of an Analysis Service database.

Corrected an issue where reference lines formatting could not be changed in workbooks created in version 5.0 that are opened in version 5.1.

Tableau Reader no longer incorrectly places the user directory (My Tableau Repository) at the root level (C:/) rather than in the My Documents folder.

A table calculation on a discrete measure would not correctly distinguish missing values. This error has been corrected.

Corrected a case where the application would unexpectedly exit when editing the color legend title.

Tableau Server
Improved the performance of very large categorical quick filters.

Optimized performance when loading views and dashboards that include quick filters that use the wildcard filter mode. This will be most noticeable when the underlying column the quick filter is based on includes a very large number of values.

Corrected an issue where long running queries that exceed the Tableau Server timeout could return "Session Busy" or "Unexpected Error" messages instead of a proper Session Timeout error.

Optimized performance when displaying a list of thumbnails (Views or Workbook listing pages). This improvement will reduce server resource usage during the time it takes to load a page with thumbnails.


Version 5.1.2 released April 8, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Right-click menus would sometimes show Actions that were not appropriate for the selection. For example, with two dimensions on the rows shelf and a filter action defined for each dimension, right-clicking the outer dimension values should show both actions because selecting the outer field implicitly selects the inner field.

When connected to an MSAS data source and the Hide Empty Rows option is deselected (off), placing the measure names field on the rows shelf would incorrectly always hide the empty rows. These empty rows now correctly honor the Hide Empty Rows option.

Tableau 5.0 would ignore invalid calculated fields in the Data Window (indicated by an exclamation mark) when creating or refreshing an extract. Tableau 5.1 would not create or refresh the extract until the invalid calculated field had been corrected. The v5.0 behavior was restored, and it now simply ignores these fields when creating the extract.

When connected to an MSAS data source, a context filter and a top 10 filter on fields from the same hierarchy now correctly calculates the top 10.

The error report upload capability would create files with the completion status of the upload process. These files were not being removed properly once the upload was complete.

Tableau products running with a Trial License could not access WMS map servers. The option was incorrectly hidden from the Background Maps menu. The WMS option now appears for Trial users.

Copying the trend model description, which is displayed in the Describe Trend Line dialog box, and pasting it into an Annotation, Caption, Title, or Tooltip would cause the application to unexpectedly quit.

Tableau would unexpectedly exit if one of the file names stored in the most recently used list on the Start page was saved incorrectly. This has been corrected.

Refreshing an extract when the database no longer contains the column that a Tableau filter is defined on could cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

When working with an MSAS database, the data retrieved by the View Data option now returns data values from related dimensions rather than just the key values from the related dimensions. Tableau now uses the MSAS RETURN CAPTION() clause, which substantially improves the usefulness of the data returned.

Tableau Reader could not access certain WMS servers to display maps. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where excluding data values while using Table Calculations would sometimes display values incorrectly.

All connections to Vertica databases now automatically set the ODBC connection to read-write mode (specifically ReadOnly=0). This change allows certain Tableau features to work when the default driver settings are set to readonly. Permissions on the Vertica database are still enforced to control writing to the database.

Vertica connections are now created with the transaction isolation level set to Read Committed. Prior versions of Tableau set this option to Serializable. Read Committed may provide increased performance as it allows read-oriented queries such as Tableau's to execute concurrently with write-oriented processes such as data loads on the server.

Tableau Server
Fixed an issue that was causing "No license found; Session creation failed." errors from Tableau Server. Additional logging was added to help isolate further causes of this infrequent error.

The link for Pause Automatic Updates has been changed from a text link in the upper right corner of the view to an icon on the toolbar. The icon was added to resolve a number of sizing issues when the view was scaled to a narrow size and to maintain consistency with the other toolbar commands. The new icon is the second from right on the toolbar, and toggles to indicate whether automatic updates are paused.

Quick Filters on attribute dimensions now include the (All) option. Existing workbooks need to be republished and the Internet Explorer cache may need to be cleared to reflect this change.

Filter actions were not applied correctly when following links between views on Tableau Server if the target view required a database login. This problem has been corrected and the filter values now properly pass to the target view.

Hiding a member of a set and then turning on totals would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This problem has been corrected.

There were times when clicking Refresh Data would not correctly update the view until some other change was made to the display (like modifying a filter). This has been corrected, Refresh Data will immediately update the view with the current data.

Corrected an issue where configuring Tableau Server to use MySQL as the extract engine would cause the configuration tool to unexpectedly exit.

The relative date filter dialog box on Tableau Server sometimes displayed incorrect dates in the preview area even though the actual filter was applied correctly. The preview area display has been corrected.

Workbooks with embedded passwords that are attached to scheduled extracts could fail after the first scheduled run. This problem has been corrected.

Corrected one cause of the server returning 'Session busy' messages. This correction is related to an action filter request working to update the view while a request for a tooltip is triggered from the pre-updated display. If the action ends up filtering out the data point for which the tooltip is requested, a Session Busy error could occur.

URL parameters could set fields with user filters to be null, bypassing the automatic data restriction. This problem has been corrected.

Embedded views were sizing a bit differently than in version 5.0. Fixed size dashboards created in version 5.0 that would not display scroll bars in the embedded <iframe> region would sometimes get additional padding around the view which would cause the <iframe> to show scroll bars in version 5.1. This issue has been corrected and the views now size the same in version 5.1 as they did in 5.0.


Version 5.1.1 released March 3, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
The "Edit Reference Line" menu option would show a blank option when a blank label is specified. The menu now shows the Value when there is a blank custom label.

Corrected a display problem with field substitution text formatting. For example, when the first half of the substitution text is a different font than the second half.

Changing a field to discrete or continuous when some data has been hidden would cause the view to become empty. The hidden data is now restored when the field is changed.

Setting a Wildcard filter on a Set could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This as been corrected.

Corrected a problem where characters were truncated in mark labels for lines when turning on Grand Totals.

Changing the data type from date to datetime (or vice versa) on a field that was used in a quick filter on a dashboard would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where axes could be resized incorrectly and not show the zero line and/or incorrectly add scroll bars.

Relative Date quick filters using custom anchors now correctly account for fiscal years.

Measure Values used in Mark Annotations now correctly display the value. In some cases this field would display as null or the field name rather than the value.

Duplicating dashboards that contain a URL action could cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This has been corrected.

When using a regional setting where the thousands separator is a period ( . ) and the decimal separator is a comma ( , ) calculated fields using constants entered with a period decimal value would not correctly calculate. For example: [Profit] * 1.4 would not calculate correctly as the decimal setting on the locale had been set to a comma and the calculation was using a period in the constant. This has been corrected.

Tableau Server
<WorkbookName> substitution text now displays in views published to Tableau Server.

Corrected an issue with tabcmd timing-out when publishing long-running workbook (TWB) files.

The "Pause Automatic Updates" link has been added back to the toolbar area for embedded views.

The 'Share' and 'Download' buttons on the embedded view toolbar now are also not displayed when the &:toolbar=no parameter is included on the URL.

Also added tabadmin commands to allow the administrator to globally turn off the 'Share' and 'Download' buttons on embedded views. The new commands are:
tabadmin set vizqlserver.showshare false
tabadmin set vizqlserver.showdownload false

Saving and reopening the workbook after adding a reference line that uses a field on the Level of Detail shelf and the field is then removed from the shelf would cause the application to unexpectedly exit. This issue has been corrected.

The Distribution pane in the Reference Line dialog box now uses the correct list separator as defined by the locale for the percentages, percentiles, and standard deviations text box. For example, European locales use a semicolon ( ; ) separator instead of a comma ( , ) like in the U.S.

Trusted authentication capabilities were not working in version 5.1. The error message "Invalid authenticity token error" would be displayed in the browser. This has been corrected.

Corrected display problems with single value quick filters that only have one possible value. The title and radio button options would be combined onto one line rather than two.

Internet Explorer could get a "tagName is null or not an object" error when accessing the Licensing page. This has been fixed.

Long running queries to populate quick filters could block requests from other users causing the server to appear sluggish. These queries are now run as non-blocking.

The user agent value for certain international browsers could cause an error when the value is written to Tableau Server logs. This issue has been corrected.

The Next/Previous links now show correctly on the full search results page that loads when you click the "All Views" link on the abbreviated search results page.

Corrected an error that would sometimes cause a "Session Busy. Please retry later." message.



Version 5.1 released February 11, 2010.
Tableau Desktop 5.1 helps you explore data better and author beautiful visualizations. Tableau Server 5.1 is even faster, more secure, and easier to manage with a new user interface. And it scales to very large implementations, so your entire company can share data and explore visualizations.


Version 5.0.10 released April 8, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
When connected to an Excel workbook, calculated fields that use the STDDEV function can cause errors related to null values when selecting View Data. This has been corrected.

When using a custom sql connection, Tableau would sometimes become unresponsive after following a filter action that filters on specific fields and has the same source and target sheets. This issue has been corrected.


Version 5.0.9 released March 3, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Added support for the MySQL 'text' datatype. Tableau returns the first 10,000 characters for columns defined as this datatype.

Corrected a problem calculating Bins when the column being binned is a calculation based on a date part.

Tableau now displays an option to cancel when opening a file from a networked file server that is taking a long time to respond.

Corrected an error that occurred when connecting to Microsoft Analysis Services cubes that include a dimension with no hierarchy.

When working with Microsoft Analysis Services databases, changing the aggregation of a measure would incorrectly change the number format to exclude decimals even if a decimal format setting had been specifically set for that field. This issue has been corrected.


Version 5.0.8 released February 8, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
When connecting to a DB2 database from an Italian Windows system, data now displays correctly when commas are used as the decimal separator.

Corrected an issue where an error would occur using a filter action with an ampersand symbol (&) in the name of the source or target fields for the filter (e.g., 'Make & Model').

When using a Microsoft Analysis Services database, canceling a query that is followed by a new query (e.g., adding a new column to one of the shelves after canceling a query) would display a "The protocol is disconnected!" error. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an SQL error when performing string truncation calculations against Teradata databases by replacing use of LENGTH with CHARACTERS.

Corrected an issue where connecting to an Oracle database using a name defined in the tnsnames.ora would sometimes cause the following error: "ORA-25406 could not generate a connect address. Cause: Failover was unable to generate an address for a backup instance."

Corrected a problem on certain systems where adding a measure to an existing view would exit the application. The underlying issue was related to the particular video driver in use.

When using double-byte languages there were cases where Tableau could generate SQL statements with column aliases beyond the 30 character Oracle identifier limit. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Corrected one case where Tableau Server would display the message "An unexpected error occurred. If you continue to receive this error, please contact your Tableau Server Administrator. Would you like to reset this view?"



Version 5.0.7 released January 11, 2010.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected problem with non-U.S. Oracle databases and the DATETRUNC() function.

Corrected an SQL error when performing string truncation calculations against Teradata by replacing use of LENGTH with CHARACTERS.

Corrected a problem where Oracle queries would get the error "ORA-01406: fetched column value was truncated," when querying a number with a very large number of digits (e.g., over 80 digits).

Tableau Server
The Table of Contents in the Tableau Server Help now displays correctly in the Windows version of Safari and Chrome web browsers.

The version of Postgres bundled with Tableau Server has been upgraded to Version 8.3.8. This upgrade includes Postgres security updates and fixes an intermittent Postgres memory overwrite problem.



Version 5.0.6 released December 3, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Improved performance of some quick filters that use 'All Values' by removing unnecessary joins to obtain the correct set of possible values.

Added support for Vertica 3.5.

When using Essbase 7, quick filters were not correctly showing the hierarchy of members. This has been corrected.

Expanded the limit for the number of items allowed in the Essbase and Microsoft Analysis Services data window tree view from 32,767 to 2,147,483,648.

Tableau Server
Added _comments to the list of database views available in the Tableau Server repository that can be accessed for custom reporting on server usage.

Tableau Server would occasionally return a "session busy error" when trying to load a tooltip before a view completed its initial rendering. This has been corrected.



Version 5.0.5 released November 5, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Added logic to handle the Adobe PDF limit of a page can't be more than 200 inches tall. Tableau now automatically breaks the output smaller than 200 inches if the page being requested would exceed the PDF limit.

When connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database, using the Find in the Edit Set dialog box now correctly searches the full domain of values.

When using a Microsoft Analysis Services database configured to use the HTTP pass-through as the connection handler, Tableau now treats the MSAS error "HTTP Header not found" properly and reconnects to the database automatically.

Updated the version of gdiplus.dll distributed with Tableau Desktop (this applies only to Windows 2000 systems).

Drilling-up in a MSAS cube now correctly clears filter actions.

When using a non-English Microsoft Analysis Services data source, Tableau would in some cases not correctly use the proper locale formatting for numbers, causing #Error displays for the numbers. This has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Updated the version of MSVCRT distributed with Tableau Server to version 2.0.50727.4053.

Dashboard titles would become misaligned horizontally (for example would no longer be precisely centered) after resizing the browser window. This has been corrected.



Version 5.0.4 released October 12, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Certain Oracle queries using Case or If statements would generate the following Oracle error, "ORA-12704: character set mismatch." The issue was related to certain data types and collations and has been corrected.

Added an option when connecting to a WMS server (as a map source) to return the map image as a single large image rather than returning tiled maps. Enable this option if your WMS server has drawing anomalies (e.g., layering alignment problems).

Improved performance of some filter actions when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services databases. These actions would perform significantly slower than the same filter in Tableau 4.1.

Creating a Tableau Extract no longer truncates some characters from Japanese strings.

Optimized queries for quick filters on sets to avoid the application unexpectedly exiting. This was only an issue when connected to large Microsoft Analysis Services databases.

Canceling queries that are running against a Microsoft Analysis Services cube no longer causes Tableau to unexpectedly exit.

Turning on data labels for a measure that is being used as a dimension and contains null values no longer causes the application to unexpectedly exit.

When using Teradata 'Role' permissions to control access to tables, Tableau now handles nested roles when discovering available databases and tables.

Corrected a problem where sometimes Tableau Desktop trial installations could not run when using Remote Desktop.

Tableau Server
The Tableau Server Administrative page listing users now indicates which users have Publish permissions because they are an admin or project leader using a grey check mark. Green check marks indicate the user has been explicitly granted the publish right.

Optimized the JavaScript used in large tables which will avoid the browser showing the following warning: "Unresponsive script: A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding..."

Requesting PNG versions of a view via tabcmd now uses the latest data from a scheduled extract.

When a long running scheduled extract job fails it is now correctly restarted so it can complete. Before this change, the jobs would not complete and mark the job as Pending in the Task History view on the server.

When connected to an Oracle database, calculated fields that use a field that is a varchar and another field that is a number would cause an Oracle error: ORA-12704 (char set mismatch). Tableau now correctly converts the datatypes to be compatible for the calculation.

When installing Tableau Server to a directory other than the default C:\Program Files location on Vista or Windows 2008, the application generated data content is now stored in the same directory as the application files instead of the default directory. This change allows you to install Tableau Server completely on a drive other than the C drive.


Version 5.0.3 released September 9, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
When working with Oracle databases that are defined with NLS_LANG=ENGLISH_CANADA.WE8MSWIN1252 Tableau would return a "#Error" in place of number columns.

Corrected a problem where Tableau would unexpectedly exit when using a background image whose x-y coordinates were outside the range of any data returned by the query.

Setting a manual default sort using Microsoft Analysis Services and additionally setting unique values to be By Name would cause the application to unexpectedly exit.

Using Microsoft Analysis Services and Actions to set filters could cause duplicate filter names to be created when the cube has the same name field in a hierarchy and an attribute, which would cause an error. This has been corrected.

Added support for Vertica views in Vertica version 3.0.7.

After copy/paste data from Excel into Tableau, Excel would no longer open files when an XLS would be double-clicked. Excel would launch, it would just not open the file. This was caused by Tableau incorrectly setting Excel to "Ignore other applications that use DDE". Tableau 5.0.3 no longer sets this Excel option. To restore Excel back to the original setting, select File > Excel Options > Advanced, and uncheck the option to "Ignore other applications that use DDE".

Adding a reference line to a worksheet that uses a datetime field built against Microsoft Analysis Services would only allow specifying a time value for the reference line. A full datetime value may now be entered.

Corrected a case where a color legend on a particular dashboard would cause Tableau to abruptly exit when opening the dashboard.

Added support for text files defined as containing fixed-width columns by a schema.ini file.

Selecting multiple invalid measures in the data window to delete them would cause Tableau to unexpectedly exit. This has been fixed.

Setting a quick filter on a column that is defined as a Group with the names of the members beginning with a numeric character would sometimes improperly show certain items as unselected.

Corrected additional cases where certain Oracle queries would generate an Oracle error Ã?ORA-12704: character set mismatch.Ã“

Tableau Server
When displaying sub-windows in Internet Explorer 8 (e.g., adding tags to a view), the underlying page is now correctly inactive and shaded.

Tableau Server now remembers the last display of the header area for views as being either expanded (the default) or collapsed.

Added recognition of the Tableau Server running in SSL mode to the Tableau-provided web part for SharePoint.

Tableau Server users that "own" a project were not showing the checkmark in the columns for Publisher on the Users page in the Admin section.

Views displayed by Tableau Server could visibly squash or stretch their size on an update. The server now takes a different approach to updating the images to minimize the flash of distortion.

URL filters to views based on Microsoft Analysis Services cubes would sometimes, seemingly randomly, get an error loading. This has been corrected by properly determining when an attribute or part of a hierarchy is referenced in the URL filter.


Version 5.0.2 released August 4, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a problem when creating an extract that would result in the message: "Firebird database error 335544321: arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string truncation. Unable to properly calculate the domain for the field 'column name'. Displayed data may be incorrect." The issue was related to a collation difference between the original database and the Tableau extract engine.

Added support for Vertica 3.0. Also now support connections to views in Vertica databases.

Rotating text when using Japanese, Chinese, or Korean characters no longer cuts off the last character.

Made improvements to completely clean up temporary files when the application closed.

Opening a workbook that contains groups would sometimes fail when the underlying data used in the groups have changed. Tableau now warns of this condition and opens the workbook.

Updated the Oracle drivers that are redistributed by Tableau to version 10.2.0.4. The new drivers correct a number of issues, most notably with connecting to 64-bit Oracle servers. Tableau Server includes the drivers in the installer; drivers for Tableau Desktop are available on the Download Drivers page.

Some views and dashboards published to a PDF file would print at reduced quality from what was shown on the screen. This has been corrected.

In version 5.0, Tableau began creating tables rather than temporary tables for some tasks to correct an issue caused by certain restrictions with MySQL temporary tables. Tableau no longer creates tables in the cases where the person has 'create table' permission but does not have the database permission to drop those tables.

Domain values for quantitative filters now compute more efficiently.

Added additional automatic reconnect logic for Microsoft Analysis Services connections when the database drops the connection.

Integer fields may now be used as latitude & longitude for geographic roles.

Corrected case where using a quick filter on a dashboard for a field that no longer exists in the database would cause Tableau to abruptly exit when opening the dashboard.

Mark label drag handles (yellow diamonds) are once again drawn correctly when a label is selected.

Selecting Refresh Extract after changing the default aggregation for a measure in the Data window would not use the new aggregation. Tableau now correctly recognizes the change.

When connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services database, single-member slicing filters now correctly filter to a single member rather than the entire hierarchy.

Creating a Tableau Extract would truncate some characters from Japanese strings. This has been corrected.

Certain Oracle queries using Case or If statements would generate an Oracle error "ORA-12704: character set mismatch". The issue was related to certain data types and collations.

Corrected a problem when creating an extract that would result in some filters returning no values. The issue was related to a collation difference between the original database and the Tableau extract engine.

Tableau Server
Tableau Server views embedded into another application would not display in Internet Explorer when the other application & Tableau Server were installed on computers in different domains. This has been corrected.

Simplified the syntax required for passing URL filters to views built from cube datasources (MSAS & Essbase). The original syntax required each filter to provide a fully qualified definition (such as [Country].[State].[City]=[Country].[State].&26[Seattle]). The new streamlined syntax is to simply provide a name=value pair. For hierarchies a name=value for each higher level of the hierarchy does need to be provided. An example of the new syntax would be: Country=US&State=WA&City=Seattle

Workbooks with a scheduled extract that make use of the User Filters capability now correctly work on Tableau Server. When the scheduled extract is run, it performs the query as the username of the person that originally published the workbook.

Certain long-running tabcmd commands may reach a timeout before completion. A new option has been added to the tabcmd utility to specify a longer timeout setting. The timeout setting may now be extended with the new global option: --timeout seconds (where "seconds" is the number of seconds before time out) to the end of any tabcmd command.

When a Microsoft Analysis Services cube is rebuilt, if the structure of the cube changes, MSAS will disconnect all sessions that are open to it. This causes Tableau sessions to be disconnected. Any open Tableau Server view will get a message from MSAS that states "Current session is no longer valid due to structural changes." Tableau now does not display this message and will automatically reconnect to the database to display the view. If the structural changes did not impact the current view then everything proceeds correctly. If the changes did impact the current view, then other messages will be displayed informing of this.

Corrected a problem in determining permissions for a particular published view, which prevented the view from being loaded for certain users.


Version 5.0.1 released July 1, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Added logic to specifically set Sunday as the first day of a week for date calculations when working with SQL Server databases.

When connected to a Teradata data source, Tableau now limits the number of columns included in the index of temporary tables to avoid surpassing the Teradata limit.

Corrected an issue where time values would not be included with Date columns when creating extracts from an Oracle data source.

Dashboard quick filters and legends now use the Default Worksheet font (Format > Font). This change is particularly useful for Asian languages where the filters and legends were not being drawn in unicode-aware fonts.

Added the ability to 'Revert to Saved' when working with Packaged Workbooks (TWBX). This command is also now enabled in Tableau Reader.

Exporting worksheets to PDF would sometimes clip the right border of the right-most item on the page. This has been corrected.

Removed delay when using the "other" option to specify the field delimiter for text files. The text box to specify an "other" character now displays immediately.

Optimized performance for text file data sources that use sets to filter a view by excluding the members of the set.

Corrected problem computing confidence intervals or standard deviation reference lines on a per-pane basis when one of the panes has no values.

For Teradata data sources, fixed SQL query errors in operations on mixed DATE/DATETIME data types.

Corrected a problem with the SQL generated when working with Oracle databases and certain complex calculated fields.

The message "The custom geocoding directory c:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau 5.0\local\data\ has errors." would sometimes incorrectly appear when opening views. This has been corrected.

Added additional checks at application shutdown for completely cleaning up temporary files created by Tableau.

Named Pipe connections are now only created when needed by the application. Pre-creating this type of connection would sometimes cause the following error message: "UniquifyForUser failed to get unique name size, code 14."

Improved anti-aliasing for font sizes greater than 48 points.

Editing Actions that were created as sheet links in previous versions no longer causes the application to fail.

Fixed problem where selecting Window > Cascade in a workbook with a large number of sheets would freeze the application.

Corrected a filtering problem when using a count or count distinct function on a column with a very long name.

When using Microsoft Analysis Services data sources and MSAS remote sets in a Tableau filter, you could get a message about "The definition of the set contains a circular reference." This has been corrected.

Corrected a problem with converting number fields to dates after creating an extract from a data source that uses Microsoft Jet. The resulting date would be off by 2 days due to a discrepancy between the Jet and Tableau definitions of "day 0."

Action filters now display in alphabetical order on tooltips.

Publishing a dashboard to a PDF would sometimes truncate the text in color legends, even when the space on the dashboard was manually sized to show the full text values.

Corrected an infrequent error when creating a URL action that uses field values as parameters in the url.

The application now always considers Sunday as the first day of the week. This fixes week boundary calculations that would sometimes break on Monday.

Workbooks using extracts and calculated field definitions that are over 64k in size could garble the data model when loading. This has been corrected.

Tableau Server
Using prompted logon for Analysis Services views (as opposed to having the Tableau Server logon as its 'runas' identity) would not correctly reconnect when the user selected to 'remember my password'. This now works correctly.

Tooltips now display when viewing Tableau Server administrative views.

Exporting images, data, data as cross-tab, or PDF files from Tableau Server now displays a status window while generating the file. Once the file is ready, a link is provided to download it.

Global filters on embedded views now properly update with values passed in the URL.

Tableau Server does not support filter or highlight actions that use the "All Fields" option and point to a sheet that is not shown on the current page. These actions are now hidden from the tooltip for menu actions and silently ignored for hover and selection actions. In prior versions these actions would display an error.

On some systems Tableau Server would stop responding to requests after an initial few would succeed. This has been corrected.

Updated the Tableau Server Repository views. The view_url column in the _views table now includes the proper URL fragment.

When displaying sub-windows in Internet Explorer 8 (e.g., adding tags to a view), the underlying page is now correctly inactive and shaded.

The tabcmd command line utility can now publish dashboards.

Optimized performance of initially loading a view. All views should load 1 second faster now.



Version 5.0 released May 28, 2009.
Tableau 5.0 helps you explore data better, is faster, more secure, and easier to manage. As a major release it contains more than 60 new features across four themes: active dashboards, rich authoring, new data options, and performance. It also contains many corrections that will improve your desktop and server experience.




Version 4.1.9 released August 4, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected a case where temp files created during retrieval of map tiles could conflict with each other and cause the application to exit.



Version 4.1.8 released July 1, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Connections to Analysis Services cubes would not automatically reconnect when the database server data is updated. Reconnect logic has been enhanced to handle these cases.

Added additional checks at application shutdown for completely cleaning up temporary files created by Tableau.

Corrected problem of not being able to query an Oracle synonym defined on a view.

Corrected a case where requesting to View Underlying Data would return no results when a filter on the sheet was a timestamp.

Tableau Server
Tableau Server could lose connections to Oracle and put the Tableau Server in a degraded state. This has been corrected.


Version 4.1.7 released May 29, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Character based fonts for Asian languages (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese) display correctly on the vertical axis when rotated.
Corrected problem of not being able to query an Oracle synonym defined on a view.

Version 4.1.6 released April 22, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Added additional reconnect logic to automatically re-establish a connection to a Microsoft Analysis Services data source when the cube becomes locked for update.


Version 4.1.5 released March 24, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Working with multiple sets as filters when connected to a Microsoft Analysis Services data source would sometimes cause an application failure. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected an issue where the message "Cannot find a total needed to compute a percentage." would be displayed. The error was related to using Table Calculations to compute percentages and certain sort specifications for the columns.

Fixed unexpected filter behavior when connected to a comma separated value (CSV) file that contained mixed case data.

Tableau Server
Connecting to a Microsoft Analysis Services data source using HTTP from Tableau Server would not override the default MSAS 30-second timeout. This issue has been corrected.


Version 4.1.4 released February 9, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
When working with the Pie mark type, holding down the Control key and dragging a field between shelves to duplicate rather than move it would cause Tableau to go into an infinite loop. This issue has been corrected.

When working with User Filters for workbooks that will be published to Tableau Server, Tableau Desktop now always updates the view correctly when you use the impersonation feature to preview the user filter settings.

When using Excel or Access data sources, Tableau Desktop now correctly applies true/false filters that are based on boolean data types.

Corrected the location for data points mapped to the province Wellington, New Zealand.

Postgres databases with the database server collation set as lc_collate = "C" are now handled correctly.

When using an Essbase data source, filters that include selections across levels would sometimes lose track of the selections. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem when editing a connection to Microsoft Analysis Services or Oracle Essbase databases. With an active connection, editing the connection to point to a different database that fails to connect for some reason would cause Tableau to unexpectedly close.

Tableau Server
Connecting to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube using HTTP from the Tableau Server was not able to override the default MSAS 30-second timeout. This has been corrected.

Project names with an ampersand character (&) in the name no longer create incomplete links in some of the Tableau Server pages.


Version 4.1.3 released January 13, 2009.
Tableau Desktop
Selection mode for quick filters on dashboards (e.g., single-select or multi-select) would revert back to multi-select mode if the workbook was saved without visiting all of the associated dashboards. The correct selection mode is now properly saved with the workbook.

When an Essbase query includes multiple instances of the same measure, some of the instances of the measure are incorrectly displayed as null. This issue has been corrected to ensure that all instances of the measure get the same value.

Special characters in names of places in Puerto Rico are now correctly encoded for mapping by CMSA, County, and State.

When setting a filter using an Essbase or Microsoft Analysis Services data source, selecting the "Replace Selection" option in the Find Values dialog box and then selecting no values would cause an application error. This issue has been corrected.

Boolean data types as true/false filters with Excel and Access data sources are now applied properly.

Tableau Server
Displaying a list of workbooks or views, sorted by name, occasionally omitted workbooks when the list spanned multiple pages. This issue has been corrected

Implemented a performance optimization for large views extending across the visible screen area. This change is most noticeable with large cross-tabs views.

Tags on views now work correctly with unicode characters (i.e., Japanese characters).

If a connection to a Microsoft Analysis Services cube is interrupted for some reason (i.e. the MSAS server is restarted), Tableau Server now correctly reconnects any open sessions which may have been live during the momentary outage.

Added support for a new parameter on the URL when invoking embedded views. The new parameter allows you to revert filters back to their initial published states. The parameter is :revert= and the possible values for this parameter are:

all - restores filters, sorts, axes
filters - restores filters
sorts - restores sorts
axes - restores fixed axes

Any new filter commands passed on the same URL with a :revert will be applied after the view is reset to its initial state.



Version 4.1.2 released December 3, 2008.
Tableau Desktop
All users with a Tableau Professional license can now connect to Teradata data sources.

All users with a Tableau Professional license can connect to Vertica data sources.


Area code boundaries and area code labels now display together correctly at lower zoom scales.

Fixed occasional crash when publishing all sheets in a workbook to PDF.

When using Custom SQL connections to Teradata, Tableau now references column names by their base name rather than any titles or aliases defined by the server. This change was required to workaround an issue with the underlying driver, which has problems with certain subqueries using titles to reference the columns.

Canceling queries to Microsoft Analysis Services would sometimes cause Tableau to fail. This has been corrected.

Using newer versions of the MySQL driver no longer causes Tableau Extract files to create columns too narrow for some of the extracted data.

Corrected an issue where installing Tableau Reader onto a computer that already has an activated version of Tableau Desktop on it would cause the message: "Unable to add license."

Selection mode for quick filters (e.g., single-select or multi-select) is now properly saved with the workbook.

When using a non-English Microsoft Analysis Services data source, Tableau now correctly interprets values that include percent formatting as percentages. 

Corrected a problem setting filters on the Tableau cache when the columns in the underlying database were defined with binary collation.

Adding a license with a new maintenance date when running Tableau on a non-U.S. English computer no longer causes activation problems.

View Underlying Data would sometimes cause an "invalid field formula" error. This issue has been corrected.

Tableau no longer can generate an "out of memory" error while calculating the size legend values.

Creating a Tableau Extract from an Excel file with a large number of very wide text columns no longer causes the error: "Firebird database error 335544849: Malformed string."

Optimized how marks are drawn when published to PDF (e.g., the +, x, and * marks). In prior versions, these marks were not drawn as smooth and symmetrical when published to PDF as they were with other outputs.

Fixed rare case where Tableau would immediately quit upon initial launch on certain machines.

Tableau Server
When using embedded views with trusted authentication, Tableau Server now correctly enforces the restriction that only the requested view may be retrieved. Access to the standard Tableau Server interface (i.e. browse or search functions) does not automatically inherit the trusted authentication session.

Creating large Tableau extract files would sometimes fail with the error: "The system cannot find the path specified." This was related to temp file paths and has been corrected.

Images and text areas placed on dashboards are no longer misaligned when displayed in IE6 browsers.

Quick filters set to use 'All Values' would incorrectly run the query for 'Relevant Values' when calculating the size of the quick filter display area. This issue has been fixed.

Corrected some display and javascript errors that occurred when using dashboards whose global filters returned zero rows of data.

Fixed an issue where views with empty categorical quick filters would not fully render. The empty quick filters were causing a javascript error that halted processing on the client.

Using the zoom tool when viewing large text table views on Tableau Server would crash one of the server processes. This issue has been corrected.

Corrected a problem where Tableau Server could not be accessed with the recently released Safari 3.2 browser.



Version 4.1.1 released October 24, 2008.
Tableau Desktop
Corrected an issue where major tick marks sometimes disappeared when changing the frequency of x-axis minor tick marks.

Corrected a problem with area annotations, where they would leave a fragment of themselves on the edge of the display when the area they were originally attached to has been scrolled off the current view.

Corrected problem with retrieving table lists from Teradata v6.x databases.

Added an option when creating a Teradata connection to specify the database first, then to show the table list for just that database. This can make establishing a connection to Teradata faster.

Using newer versions of the MySQL driver would sometimes cause Tableau Extract files to create columns too narrow for some of the extracted data.

Some WMS servers can return map images that are a single fixed scale image, rather than a scalable map layer. Tableau can only work with scalable map layers, and now does not show the option to request layers which are fixed size images.

Application no longer crashes when re-opening a workbook after changing the tick-mark frequency for charts with a continuous date on the x-axis.

Double clicking a .tms file when a Tableau workbook is open would open a second instance of the workbook.

Analysis Services offline cube files (.cub files) did not return values for the measures when running on machines using a non-English locale.

Corrected a sql error when using Teradata and multiple values on a date filter.

Removed unnecessary worksheet refresh when renaming a WMS map source.

Corrected occasional error when saving workbooks on certain machines. Issue was related to the inability to get a unique temporary file name from the operating system.

Fixed crash when publishing all sheets in a workbook to PDF for certain documents.

Copying data to a cross-tab would not retain decimal precision on the copied data. The copied data now correctly carries the decimal values.

Tableau Server
When using embedded views with trusted authentication, Tableau Server now correctly enforces the restriction that only the requested view may be retrieved. Access to the standard Tableau Server interface (i.e. browse or search functions) do not automatically inherit the trusted authentication session.

Improved performance in Tableau Server when rendering views with a very large cross-tab.

When publishing to a Tableau Server configured to use Active Directory authentication, an "Unable to send encrypted password" error occurred when the current user's Windows password was changed or reset while Tableau Desktop was open and logged on to Tableau Server. This issue has been resolved, and in this scenario Tableau now re-encrypts the new password to make the connection.

Improved performance when setting global filters on dashboards using Microsoft Analysis Services and hierarchical filters.

If the number of items in the Page drop-down for a Tableau Server view is longer than will fit on a single screen, the list would not scroll to allow selection of items further down the list. The drop-down control now scrolls when the list is long.



Version 4.1 released September 24, 2008.
New Features

Web Map Service (WMS) Support
Tableau 4.1 adds Web Map Service (WMS)support so you can retrieve custom maps from your own WMS servers. While the Tableau Online and Offline maps were carefully designed to display data effectively and beautifully for all kinds of data, the WMS support allows you to use Tableau with specialized maps that are custom to your organization. There are some public WMS servers available as well as a number of WMS enabled server products your organization may already have such as software from ESRI, MapInfo, or others. 

Tableau supports servers that have implemented the WMS 1.1.1 specification. You can download a quick start guide with step-by-step instructions for using a WMS server in Tableau 4.1 from the Quick Start Guides page. 


Active Directory Improvements
If you use Active Directory authentication with Tableau Server, the 4.1 release adds several new capabilities to help you configure domain information. You can now specify the domain nickname during installation and modify both full domain names and nicknames after the server is up and running.	Server Performance Improvements
Many customers using Tableau Server will see performance improvements with the Tableau 4.1 upgrade. Specifically pages may load faster when requesting a view. In addition, the server has improved data caching, which increases responsiveness during interactive sessions. Refresh the data cache at any time to reload from the underlying data source.
Single Logon for Multiple Sheets
Tableau Desktop now only asks you to logon to each database one time per workbook. The username and password provided are reused for each sheet that connects to the same server and database. For example, a workbook with three sheets, each connecting to different tables in the same database, will now only prompt you logon once instead of three times as in prior versions.
Connect to More Databases
Tableau 4.1 now supports connections to both Teradata and Vertica databases. You need a special product key to connect to these databases. Contact your account manager to learn more.
Other Changes

Tableau Desktop
Connections to Cache databases would sometimes be closed when opening multiple workbooks at a time. 

Corrected some syntax problems with queries to MySQL that were using FULL JOIN rather than OUTER JOIN. MySQL does not support FULL JOIN. 

Sheet links when using Microsoft Analysis Services from Tableau Server was constructing slow MDX queries. These queries have been optimized. 

Corrected an issue with querying time and timestamp data from Netezza databases. 

Datasets with Latitude or Longitude defined as discrete datatypes would cause the application to crash. This is now handled correctly. 

Tableau would crash when saving in certain cases. Issue was related to creating certain thumbnail images, which has been corrected. 

Marks drawn for zip code 14208 were placed in the wrong location. 

Corrected issue where sheet links would work would work initially, but they would fail after saving and reopening the workbook. The problem was related to links on dates not retaining the proper date formatting for the link syntax when saved. 

Corrected problem when using Tableau online maps where not all map tiles would be retrieved. 

Added support for double-clicking a TMS file to launch the application. 

Corrected problem with Tableau 4.0 and Oracle SmartView 9.3.1 being installed on the same machine. 

Corrected problems loading file fbclient.dll from Desktop clients. 

Added the ability to edit Active Directory domain names and nicknames to the Administrative interface. 

Tableau would crash after a long period of inactivity on computers running Cisco Security Agent. This issue has been corrected. 

Corrected problems with offline activation still trying to send registration information over the internet. 

Corrected problems retrieving updated maintenance renewal information. 

Tableau Server
Corrected issue of Tableau Server not being able to install on German operating systems. 

Tableau Server was performing license checks too frequently, causing poor performance when opening views while this check was performed. Tableau Server now checks for a valid license only once per day. 

Tableau Server would display the Select All option on quick filters that were set to single select mode . Choosing Select All would implicitly swap the quick filter to multi-select and then select all the values. This could cause very long running queries for large databases. Tableau Server now does not show the Select All button when in Single Select mode. 

Corrected problems when publishing very large workbooks to the Tableau Server . 

Corrected a crash in the VizQL Server process when canceling a query. 

Some workbooks with long running queries would fail when publishing to Tableau Server. A combination of code changes and server timeout settings correct this issue. 

Tableau Server sheet links were not always url-encoding properly, which would result in a message saying the destination sheet did not exist. Sheet links are now correctly url-encoded. 

Documentation improvements in the Online Help and Admin Guide relating to Active Directory trusted domains.
