v0.25
Released 7th October, 2014.
Destructible Facilties at KSC
	•	Crashing into buildings at KSC can now cause them to collapse, which although satisfying, is very counter-productive to the Space Program.
	•	Destroyed Facilities won't function until repaired, although most facilities can still operate with some degree of damage.
	•	Repairing broken facilities will cost you in Career Mode.
	•	Added a new Context Menu to Facilities at KSC which show extra info and to repair when necessary.
New Explosion Particle and Sound FX
	•	We've added a huge new set of sounds and effects, which can be seen (and heard) whenever a facility at KSC gets destroyed or repaired.
	•	Part explosions have also been overhauled for much more violent and better-looking fireworks.
New Difficulty Options Menu
	•	A new panel is now available when starting a new game (and also through the in-game settings menu) to allow configuring difficulty settings, like whether or not crews can respawn, whether facilities can be destroyed, and several other parameters.
Administration Facility
	•	Added a new facility near the Astronaut Complex, and lets you access the Strategies screen.
	•	Added a new music track to play in the background of the Admin Facility, called "Stratejazz".
Strategies
	•	Managing your Career is greatly expanded with the addition of Strategies. Strategies let you take control over how your Space Program is managed, allowing you to tune it to best fit your own playing style.
	•	Space Program Department Reps: Meet Mortimer Kerman, your Finances guy, Linus Kerman, Science rep and Wernher's intern (because Wernher is too important to be bothered with these meetings) and Walt Kerman, PR representative who takes his job very literally sometimes, and Gus Kerman, head of Operations, who hopefully cleaned his boots before showing up this time.
	•	Strategies are of course, completely mod-friendly, and defined through cfg. So are the departments, in fact.
Crew Transfer
	•	Kerbals in the same vessel don't need a spacesuit anymore to switch seats. Just click the crew hatch and select Transfer to tell them to go sit somewhere else.
Spaceplane Parts Overhaul
	•	We've incorporated many parts fromthe very awesome SpacePlane Plus mod by Chris Thuersam (PorkJet), giving stock spaceplane parts a much needed overhaul.
	•	Many, many new parts: Wing sections, Control Surfaces, Air Intakes, Fuselage Sections and even Cargo Bays added.
	•	All parts in the Mk2 set were redesigned to be symmetrical in 3 axes. They also act as lifting surfaces too.
	•	The Mk1 Cockpit and Mk1 fuselage sets were also overhauled, and we've also added a new Inline intake part.
	•	Rebuilt all stock vessels using the new parts.
	•	Obsolete spaceplane parts replaced by new ones when applicable. (Delta wing, Structural wind, Wing Connector, Mk2 fuselages)

KSC Vessel Markers
	•	You can now see (and focus/recover) vessels landed near the Space Center directly from the Space Center scene. Markers will show their positions and expand to show extra information when clicked.
NavBall Vectors
	•	The Navball now shows all 6 vectors when in Orbit mode: Progade, Retrograde, Radial In/Out, Normal and Antinormal.
	•	Off-screen maneuver vectors now have an arrow which points towards them so they're easier to find.
New
Flight
	•	Added a new stock craft, the Learstar A1: A hybrid multistage vessel that functions very much like the Shuttle did.
	•	MapView Filtering state is now persistent.
	•	Added a Full Throttle Key (Z)
	•	New "Space Center" Button above the altimeter allows you to return to the Space Center without having to go through the Pause Menu.
	•	Added MonoProp gauge to OMS engines on staging stack
	•	Added 'Return to Editor' buttons to flight end dialog when Reverting isn't allowed (due to difficulty settings).
Editors
	•	VAB and SPH scenes now show visible KSC facilities in their current states (as in destroyed).
	•	Hold ModKey to override surface attachment in editors (when you want to stack to a node but can't because the part insists on sticking to the surface).

Crew Management
	•	Automatic Crew Hiring is now disabled depending on difficulty setting.
Scenery
	•	Tweaked the main terrain shader to use worldspace triplanar mapping on near detail textures. This means we now have enough texture accuracy to texture small rocks or even blades of grass. This is still an ongoing project though, not all Celestial Bodies use this new shader yet.
R&D
	•	Entry Purchases in R&D are now required depending on difficulty mode.
	•	Added a 'Purchase All' button to purchase all parts after researching a node in R&D.
	•	Science Results in Sandbox Mode. They may not be worth much Science (or any at all), but running science experiments in Sandbox Mode will now show you the same results as in other game modes.
	•	Recovering/Transmitting Science Data requires an operational R&D Facility (as in not destroyed).
Misc
	•	GameDatabase code tweaked to allow modders to write their own asset loaders.
	•	Added GameEvents.OnCrewTransferred, fired from CrewTransfer and EVAs leaving and boarding
	•	Added SCREENSHOT_SUPERSIZE parameter to settings.cfg to allow taking ultra-high-res (multisampled) screenshots.
	•	Application Launcher added to tracking station (Messages and Contracts App visible).

Bug Fixes and Tweaks
	•	Fixed a small bug where entering the KSC scene for the first time in a session would cause it to jitter from FP inaccuracy. This fixed itself after going into other scenes, but was annoying nonetheless.
	•	Tweaked text on Editor Cost Widget, so characters align with the Funds widget below.
	•	Funds Widget now has commas to separate groups of 3 digits.
	•	Fixed a bug in the Editor which prevented some parts from attaching properly to n-couplers using symmetry (like the RamJet Turbines)
	•	Added an "Addons&Mods" button to the Main Menu, that will take you to KSP's official mod site.
	•	Massive reorganization of the part folders in the GameData directory.
	•	Inline Reaction wheel rescaled to size 0, since it was redundant with the Advanced Reaction Wheel module before.
	•	Cupola Part mass changed from 4.5 to 1.76. Total mass (with full monoprop) is now 1.8
	•	Tweaked the intake area of several intakes for better consistency.
	•	Fixed Experimental parts not being available in cases where the node was researched but the part itself not purchased.
	•	Set up a transition matrix system to bypass unnecessary loading screens on some scene transitions.

	•	Overhauled the in-game settings dialog UI, which was sorely in need of some attention.
	•	Removed useless 'None' option for Docking Lin/Rot state when assigning a key or axis in the Input Screen.
	•	Revised and updated in-game and readme credits.
	•	Fixed mouse detection for KSC facilities not working if camera was zoomed too far out.

	•	Fixed Index Out of Range exception and general crash on moving to flight after deleting a crewed part in a certain way.
	•	Kerbal recovery reward set to zero for the time being, to stop reputation exploit from recovery at the launchpad.
	•	Mk2 Cockpit renamed to Mk1 Inline Cockpit (makes a lot more sense, since it was a Mk1 type part anyway).
	•	Fixed several cases of UIs not stopping mouse clicks on objects behind themselves.
	•	Fixed a bug on OSX which made it impossible to open the Crew Hatch Dialog and possibly other dialogs too.
	•	Contracts App panel is now scalable in the VAB/SPH
	•	Fixed missing title bar on VAB/SPH on larger resolutions
	•	Fixed a bug with rescaleFactor parameter in part.cfg when a MODEL node was used.

v0.23.5
Released 1st April, 2014
New SLS-styled parts


The S3 KS-25x4 Engine Cluster becomes the most powerful engine
Because this version was developed in cooperation with NASA, there are several parts which are similar to the Space Launch System currently being developed by NASA. It also contains the first safety launch escape system and is one safety feature which is usually absent from updates.
	•	Extra large liquid fuel tanks, in full (Kerbodyne S3-14400 Tank), half (7200) and quarter-height (3600) variants. All of them carry also oxidizer.
	•	S3 KS-25x4 Engine Cluster, the single most powerful piece of rocketry ever added to KSP.
	•	Kerbodyne KR-2L Advanced Engine, for when immense amounts of thrust is required.
	•	LFB KR-1x2, the first liquid fuel booster: A new way to boost spacecraft, the LFB is a single part featuring twin engines, plus a very respectable amount of fuel. What more, more liquid fuel tanks can be stacked on top of it.
	•	The Launch Escape System: Modeled after the Apollo LES, this new escape tower can save the crew if the rocket does not behave as expected.
	•	The S1 SRB-KD25k: A SRB that is designed in the style of the SRBs used on the space shuttle and the SLS.
New part joints
	•	Large parts feature a new system that allows them to attach much more rigidly to other parts, eliminating many cases where spamming struts was required.
	•	Increased PhysX's global max angular velocity settings to improve joint stability.
	•	Angular inertia values for parts now properly scale with mass. Some ships may feel heavier to fly now, but handling feels much more realistic overall. This also improves joint stability a lot.
	•	Re-did the Strut Connector joints as well, to use the new joints system instead of their old ones. This dramatically improved their reliability and significantly reduced the number of occurrences where ships spontaneously disassemble themselves on the launchpad.
New features


Switching between MET and UT by clicking on MET
	•	Added filters in the map view to filter unknown and space objects.
	•	Focusing vessels on the Tracking Station or targeting them in map view will now display their patched conics trajectory, taking encounters with other celestial bodies into account.
	•	Added time warp controls to the Tracking Station and Space Center scenes.
	•	The clock can now show the universal time (UT). A button beside the clock allows switching between mission elapsed time (MET) and UT.
	•	Maneuver nodes are now persistent.
	•	Targeted objects are now persistent.
	•	Added buttons to discard/accept maneuvers on the delta-v gauge by the navball.
	•	Added buttons to add/remove an orbit to the date of a maneuver node, allowing nodes to be planned for several orbits ahead.
	•	Maneuver handles can now be fine-tweaked with the mousewheel when hovering over them.
	•	Monopropellant and xenon gas containers on earlier stages are now drained before containers on later stages.
	•	Celestial bodies now show a 'Focus View' button on their context menus in map view.
	•	Added named quicksave and quickload with Mod+F5 and Mod+F9. (unannounced)
Bug fixes and tweaks


The docking mode using linear controls. Switching to rotation controls won't toggle SAS anymore
	•	The part of orbits in other sphere of influences will be shown in local mode when they are focused on the map view or Tracking Station.
	•	Switching between linear and rotation controls in docking UI mode no longer toggles SAS.
	•	Fixed a bug where patched conics on extremely eccentric orbits could break the simulation at very high warp speeds.
	•	Fixed incorrect rendering of ascending and descending nodes when targeting a non-closed orbit.
	•	Fixed a bug where targeting an object on a hyperbolic orbit wouldn't display rendezvous information on the map.
	•	Tweaked the thrust and Isp values of the PB-ION Electric Propulsion System, LV-1 Liquid Fuel Engine and LV-1R Liquid Fuel Engine. All were severely underpowered to be of any practical use.
	•	The mass of the Inline Clamp-O-Tron was increased from 0.125 tons to 1 ton.
	•	Quicksaving is now allowed at all times. In unstable situations, an autosave won't be created at the same time.
	•	Greatly improved the accuracy of the physics to rails transition, eliminating drift on nearby vessels when warping during a rendezvous situation, especially high-velocity ones.
	•	The map filtering buttons now toggle independently on left click, and toggle single/all on right click.
	•	Fixed several cases where Kerbals on EVA would glitch out in very painful ways, mostly when the game changed reference frames while they were in ragdoll state.
	•	Intersection nodes between orbits no longer 'skip' the closest intersection when placing a maneuver node near the player's position.
v0.23
Released 17th December, 2013
New features


The R.A.P.I.E.R. Engine
	•	All previous earned science can now be viewed in the Science Archives in the Research and Development facility.
	•	Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-2 is a new part that functions as a portable laboratory and increases transmitted science yield.
	•	New R.A.P.I.E.R. Engine that relies on intake air while in the atmosphere, and changes fuel to oxidizer when intake air can no longer suffice as a fuel.
	•	Tweakables are different characteristics that allow changes to how certain parts function.
	•	Science system has been updated so science cannot be maxed out by transmitting. Transmitting yields a certain amount of science, and bringing the science back to Kerbin for recover yields much more.
	•	Certain science parts are now single-use, and cannot transmit data more than once, unless the instrument is cleaned with the lab module.
	•	Science data can be retrieved from an instrument by a kerbal on EVA and stored in a crew pod, like an EVA report or surface sample.
	•	New biome map for Minmus.


New part interface
	•	New interface to show the properties of the parts in the VAB and Spaceplane Hangar.
	•	Unity upgrade to version 4.2.2.
	•	6-DOF (6 Degrees of Freedom) device support for Windows only.
	•	The EVA jet pack requires the resource EVA propellant instead of a percentage. Originally planned was that the corresponding monopropellant gets deducted when the Kerbal leaves the pod.[1] But the EVA fuel gets replenished either way. That's also the reason why all command pods have now got a small amount of monopropellant on board.
Bug fixes and tweaks
	•	The spelling mistakes for the batteries were fixed.
v0.22
Released 16th October, 2013
Career Mode
	•	Career Mode is now open! Although still very much under development, you can now start new Career saves.
	•	Sandbox mode, of course, is also available from the start.
Research and Development
	•	Added the Research & Development Facility to the Space Center.
	•	R&D allows players to unlock parts (and later other stuff) by researching nodes on the Tech Tree (In Career Mode).
Science
	•	Researching requires Science, which must be earned by performing experiments during your missions.
	•	You can now collect surface samples while on EVA, and process them to do Science.
	•	Science experiments return results, which are different for each situation in which the experiment is performed.
	•	Experiments can (as all proper experiments must) be repeated over many different situations across the whole Solar System.
	•	Added a new dialog to show the results of experiments when reviewing the collected data.
	•	Added a new dialog to show a breakdown of all scientific progress made after recovering a mission.
Parts
	•	Added new scientific parts, like the Materials Bay and the Mystery Goo™ Canister. Also added experiments to many existing parts.
	•	The old science sensors now have a purpose. They all have their own experiments which enable them to log scientific data.
	•	The antennas are now functional, and can be used to transmit science data back to Kerbin, if recovering the physical experiments is not an option.
	•	Antennas consume massive amounts of power when transmitting. Make sure you have fresh batteries in.
	•	Added a new deployable antenna, which is an intermediate model compared to the two original ones.
	•	Completely remodelled the Communotron 88-88 Comms Dish. The new mesh uses the same placement rules so it won't break ships that have it.
	•	Nose Cones now actually help with improving stability during atmospheric flight.
	•	Revised a lot of part values and descriptions, in preparation for them actually meaning something in the near future.
	•	Overhauled the landing legs and gears, they now have proper shock-absorbing suspensions.
Editor
	•	Added a system to allow saving and loading of Sub-Assemblies.
	•	Subassemblies are subsets of spacecraft, which can later be attached to other designs and re-used.
Space Center
	•	The KSC Facilities have all been revised, and feature new ground meshes and many other graphical improvements.
	•	Greatly improved the Island Airfield.
	•	Added lighting FX to several facilities. The Runway (among many other things) is now properly lit at night.
	•	Added a new backdrop and soundtrack for the Astronaut Complex Facility.
	•	Added a new music track for the R&D Facility.
Flight
	•	It is now possible to recover a flight after landing/splashdown on Kerbin without going through the Tracking Station. Look above the Altimeter.
	•	The SAS system was again largely overhauled, based on all the feedback we've gotten from everyone. It's now more stable than ever.
Solar System
	•	Celestial Bodies now support Biome Maps, which are used to create different conditions for experiments.
	•	Biomes are currently implemented on Kerbin and on the Mun, more will be added on later updates.
Launcher
	•	We've got a new launcher application for KSP, featuring a news bulletin, patcher management, and also allows you to tweak settings from outside the game.

Released 1st December, 2012
New:
	•	Docking: Connecting vessels together is now possible! Build space stations, surface bases, or assemble huge spacecraft in orbit.
	•	Flight Planning: Getting to other planets and moons just got a lot simpler. Place maneuvers along your orbit to create a flight plan, and then just follow the guidance cues. No need to figure out angles or hold a protractor to the screen!
	•	Improved Map UI: New map icons show close approaches, intersections with other orbits, and a lot more, so you can focus on getting where you want to go, instead of worrying about how to get there.
	•	New Vessel Types and Vessel Renaming: Building a station? You can now rename and set your vessel as one of several new types, so it'll show on the map with the appropriate icon and name.
	•	Automatic Fairings: Rockets now look like proper rockets! Several parts now have automatic fairings that pop up whenever something is stacked below them, and then jettison away during flight.
	•	Much Improved Models and Textures: Many of the old parts have been completely redone, with carefully constructed meshes and hand painted textures, to give KSP a new look.

	•	New Input Modes: No need to have two hands on the keyboard and a third one on the mouse anymore. New input modes make for much more ergonomic controls, and it's all remappable!
	•	Two new celestial bodies: New places to explore, with interesting and varied terrain.
	•	New Resources System: Watching fuel drain has never been so much fun! New resources allow for completely new possibilities. Energy, Fuel, Oxidizer and other resources now flow through your ship. Manage them as you fly, and pump them across parts.
	•	Electricity: More power to the Kerbals! Many new functional electrical parts added, like Solar Panels, Batteries, and even a Nuclear Reactor!
	•	Lights: Landing on the nightside just got a lot less deadly, with new landing and floodlight parts.
	•	Functional Air Intakes: Turbines now properly require air to run, and Intakes can provide it for them, as long as there is an atmosphere around you.
	•	Music: KSP now has its own soundtrack, featuring many cool tracks, from smooth jazzy tunes to build ships by, to wondrous spacy themes as you explore the solar system.
	•	Much improved planets: Kerbin looks a lot better now, with hand-built terrain features. Moho and Eve also got major overhauls, and many others have also been improved.

	•	Reduced the minimum collider intersection threshold to much less than before. Should increase collision accuracy and hopefully solve issues like landing gear going through the ground. (all thanks to above fix)
	•	[API Change] MemoryStream wrappers that were mistakenly not committed for 1.15.1 have been added to the code.
	•	Packing/Unpacking ships is now done without affecting the ship's scene hierarchy. Now, vessels take care of keeping their own parts in place while packed, making for much more stable physics behavior when going in and out of time warp.
	•	Improved vessel/part loading from persistence procedure, for more stable and accurate flight resuming.
	•	Fixed a bug in the Tracking Station scene, which prevented scrolling the vessel list.
	•	The Vessel Switching keys now only cycle between nearby vessels and won't cause the scene to reload anymore. To switch to far-away vessels, you must use the map view.
	•	Added key and axis bindings for EVA controls. Reorganized the Input Settings screen a little.
	•	Added separate control bindings for walking and jetpacking on EVAs.
	•	Added 1:1 EVA rotation axes. Using them disables the automatic orientation system.
	•	Fixed RCS and SAS toggling on other vessels.
	•	Vessels take collision impact momentum into account whenever possible
	•	Fixed a problem where vessels would be stuck as 'Landed' if boarding a part while in contact with another.
	•	Fixed issues with the large Landing Leg colliders.
	•	Added patcher auto-updater. Will redownload the patcher if a better version is available.
	•	Tweaked Physics settings to reduce landed part wobble.
	•	It is now possible to close the Flight End screen without leaving the flight scene (to switch vessels).
	•	Tweaked part collision handling for better efficiency.
	•	Landing Legs now use a much improved collision handling system, eliminating leg wobble on heavy ships.
	•	PartTools can now serialize WheelCollider components.
	•	Improved detection/response to vessels below terrain and much better terrain altitude detection for vessels.
	•	It is no longer possible to save the game (or switch vessels) while very close to the ground and not landed (could cause terrain fallthrough).
	•	Fixed the crew capacity values on the part.cfg files.
	•	Fixed the Orbit initialization routine, to prevent NaN errors on landed craft
	•	Fixed parts that use the Part class having a "Part Type not available" message on their descriptions at the VAB.
	•	mbm texture files are now DXT compressed and cleared from RAM as soon as they're uploaded to the GPU. RAM usage is massively improved.
	•	Fixed some issues with the patched conic solver not finding proper SOI transitions sometimes.

	•	Landed/Splashed vessels no longer show an Apoapsis icon on the Map View.
	•	The Map Camera now responds to the keyboard bindings for camera zoom.
	•	Decouplers now obey the second law of physics (Acceleration = Force/Mass)

	•	RCS Fuel Tanks now drain symmetrically if placed using symmetry.
	•	Fixed the flight scene time step being incorrectly initialized as 0.04ms (would cause wobbly physics).
	•	Fixed a problem with the Plugins folder in the Mac version, which caused the game to halt when loading.
	•	Fixed an issue that caused incorrect staging when loading ships in the flight scene.

v0.13
Released 16th December, 2011
Optimizations:
	•	Removed a lot of needless halts on the part processing routine during loading.
	•	Restructured the sound loading system so the main loading thread doesn't wait for it to finish before moving on.
	•	Deferred adding of several part components so they're only added when they're needed.
	•	Mesh tangents can now be loaded from file, instead of being recalculated every time.
	•	The mesh loader now ignores materials from file, because they were going to be replaced anyway later.
	•	Meshes are now saved to binary files (serialized) when loaded for the first time, and loaded from those files when they're available.
	•	Changed the rendering method for the part icons on the staging sequence. This can prevent thousands of objects from being created when flying large ships.
	•	Ship parts now have adjustable levels of physics, so small parts are not as deeply simulated as large ones. This reduces the amount of physics objects and joints to simulate.
	•	Reduced the amount of code components attached to each part, making for less calls on each frame.
	•	Tweaked the part heat exchange model, for a considerable fps boost with very large ships.
New on 0.13:
	•	The part loader will check if the saved optimized meshes are out-of-date, and update them when necessary.
	•	A new Fuel Line part, that allows fuel to be drained off external (side-mounted) tanks.
	•	It is now possible to warp time freely when the ship is landed.
	•	Added a progress bar for the loading screen.
	•	Pressing F2 will hide the UI completely (so you can take UI-free screenshots).
	•	Added a new icon for the Fuel Line parts.
	•	Changed the icon grouping rule on RCS Blocks and Strut Connectors to group to all parts of the same type on it's stage.

Bug Fixes:
	•	Fixed the mission timer not getting started if the first stage was moved before launching.
	•	Liquid Fuel now flows from the top attachment node, instead of from the parent part (unless there is no top node, in which case it flows from the parent part).
	•	Parts now keep the references to the part attached in each attachment node. (makes top-node based fuel flow possible)
	•	Fixed a bug which prevented the ship selection dialogs from receiving double-click events. Now it is possible to select a ship file by double clicking on it.
	•	Improved rendering of hyperbolic (escape) orbits in the map view. The trajectory is now a constant size regardless of eccentricity, and isn't warped by the splines.
	•	The Map camera will now remember it's last position, and return to it when the map is reopened.
	•	Fixed a problem that made it possible to delete the command pod in the VAB by using Ctrl+Z.
	•	Increased the heat conductivity and heat dissipation values for all parts, to compensate for the new heat exchange system.
	•	Exposed a 'thrustVector' cfg parameter for Liquid Engines. This allows you to set the 'default' thrust direction for an engine, same as with SRBs
v0.12
Released 11th November, 2011
New on 0.12:
	•	A Moon
	•	New Orbital Camera Mode. Like Free Mode, but aligned to the solar system plane, like the Map View Camera is.

	•	Tidied up the flight statistics numbers formatting a bit, so they're easier to make sense of.
	•	Time Warp will now smoothly increase/decrease towards the set time rate, for a much more fluid transition.
	•	Made several improvements to the Map View orbit rendering.
	•	Fixed the rails-&amp;amp;gt;physics transition, so that there is no significant change anymore in orbital parameters when going out of warp.
	•	Made some significant improvements to the physical joints that hold the ship together. Ships will not wobble anymore when going back into 1x time after warping, and the joints themselves are more stable overall.
	•	Made a small tweak to the part tooltips on the VAB, to prevent them from going off-screen on small resolutions. (was noticeable with the new command pod selection dialog)

	•	New "Atmosphere" Gauge in the UI, indicates how deep the ship is in the planet's atmosphere.
	•	The Orbit system can now track and propagate hyperbolic (escape) trajectories.
	•	Parts can now cast shadows on themselves.

	•	The MET display will now start counting on liftoff instead of on flight start.
	•	Tuned the terrain system a bit, to improve visual quality at high altitudes.
	•	Greatly improved the input lock system. Now, components that lock game controls won't override locks placed by other components.
	•	Improved the flight camera code. On Chase mode the camera will not spin around at the poles anymore, and both modes are more stable overall.

	•	Undo/Redo actions in the VAB, by Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y
	•	Fuel tanks are now stackable to increase fuel amount (and weight )
	•	On-screen text popup to let you know the current camera mode
	•	Cfg interpreter can now parse 2D, 3D, and 4D Vectors, as well as rotations (in angle-axis format)
	•	Cfg-defined thrust positions and orientations, make retro-rockets and any other craziness open for addon parts.
	•	Parts may now create new stages for themselves through the cfg (used to be decouplers only)
	•	New texture for the Solid Rocket Booster
	•	The game now checks for updates against the KSP site, and let's you know if there is a new version available
	•	Loading screen moved to before the main menu appears.
Bug fixes:
	•	Liquid Engine particle effects responding to engine cutoff
	•	Icon indicators for all parts that need to show information
	•	Custom icons for all part types
	•	VAB placement bug with tricouplers and fuel tanks (and decouplers)
	•	Reposition the Navball and main camera focus, so the ship isn't obscured by the interface - this one is kinda moot now, since the new camera centers the ship better, and the navball doesn't hide the ship anymore.
	•	Pause also affecting particle effects
	•	Pausing the game no longer produces a G-force peak
	•	SRB mesh normals correction
	•	Complete rewrite of the flight camera code. No more jitters and a number of new options in the settings.cfg
	•	Relaunch button on pause menu. No need to end flight to relaunch.
	•	Version text on main menu resetting after returning to it from game.
	•	Inverted the middle mouse button zoom. Now mouseing forward brings the camera closer.
	•	The text on the stage indicators no longer appears over other interface elements
	•	Fixed excessive wobbliness with side-attached parts
	•	Radial decouplers now have their own module (they used to share modules with the stack decoupler)
	•	Increased the inclination range for the VAB camera from 45° to 80°
	•	Updated tutorial to reflect the changes made in this update (like the new cameras in flight).
	•	Tweaked the Radial Decoupler separation. It can now eject lit SRBs safely away from the ship and not kill the crew everytime.

Notable Features
	•	Downloaded over 5000 times[3]
	•	No SAS, although SAS module is implemented and generates torque

	•	The AV-R8 Winglet is just a fin and can't be used to control the vehicle
	•	It is nearly impossible to achieve orbit
	•	Kerbin is the only celestial object, does not rotate, and is a mirror reflection of the example planet from libnoise
	•	The sun is a directional light source at infinite distance
	•	The render distance is only 1500 km, and Kerbin will "sink" into the sky background, vanishing entirely as that altitude is achieved
	•	The original Intercontinental Kraken had not been fixed (Moving far from the KSC will result in shaking and even Rapid Unplanned Disassembly.
