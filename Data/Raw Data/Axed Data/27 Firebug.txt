This adoption has been done and our entire test suite composed of about 400 automated tests finally passed and all tests are green (issue 7166). Since we have done a lot of changes and also the Firebug UI went through a great face lift, we are going to call the next version Firebug 2.0 alpha 1! (will be available next week)
