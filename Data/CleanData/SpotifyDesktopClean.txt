Additional technical notes:

The Desktop application uses the "Chromium Embedded Framework" (CEF), which is a way to include the functionality of a web browser (based on Chrome) in the application - this enables us to develop features in modern programming languages and gives us the possibility to fix issues faster.



This update includes a major upgrade, from CEF1 to CEF3.



CEF 1 was "single process" and if it got stuck doing something - the whole application would "suffer."

CEF 3 is a "multi process" version - this means it can do more things at the same time, and if any single thing that it is doing slows down, the rest of the application can continue normally.

CEF 3 also allows us to use hardware acceleration on graphics cards - like the latest browsers, it basically uses the computer's hardware both smarter and faster. Users should see much smoother performance in areas that are graphics intensive, like scrolling through long lists.



What is worth mentioning though is that this is a major "under the hood" change (techies may be interested in reading more on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework.)

Also, there's always a risk of unexpected issues with such "big" changes, but we are sure that it's the right thing for us to do - and hopefully our users will understand that they will get a much improved experience thanks to this.
