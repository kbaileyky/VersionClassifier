Version Number: 2.9
Release Date: 2013-07-24T01:16:12Z
What's new in 2.9

Follow for all

Forming relationships on Raptr is now easier than ever. We know it was a bit confusing before as to whether you "friended" someone or "followed" them -- so we_re switching over to a follower system. With this update, the iOS app has been updated to reflect the changes on Raptr.com, which in the simplest terms means that there is no longer a "Friend Requests" menu.

You will still get push notifications with new followers, and as always can disable them in your Notifications Preferences.


Other changes in this update:

- Some users have two factor authentication enabled on their Xbox account, which we don't support at this time. Instead of simply giving an error previously when you attempt to connect your Xbox account (as if you've entered your login credentials incorrectly), we now detect this condition and alert you to that fact. Don't fret, we hope to support two factor auth in a future update!
