VMware Fusion 7.0 | 02 September 2014
These release notes cover the following topics:
What's New
Known Issues


What's New
VMware Fusion Pro has been updated for OS X Yosemite. Visual changes include a new flatter application icon, changes to include translucent elements, and Yosemite style full-screen behavior.

VMware Fusion Pro includes the latest virtual hardware revision with support for:
Advanced Haswell processor features, including AVX2 inside a virtual machine
A new virtual webcam, making it easier than ever to use your webcam with Windows applications
An updated, virtual USB controller with support for XHCI 1.0
A new approach to video memory that enables the VRAM limit to be specified per virtual machine
The amount of VRAM configured is not limited by the VRAM available to the host.
The ability to specify a preference for the integrated or discrete GPU
On recent Mac Book Pros that contain both GPUs, this can result in increased battery life for lightly used virtual machines.
VMware Fusion Pro is more efficient than ever with wake-ups reduced by over 60% for lightly used virtual machines.

OS X Yosemite can now be used inside a virtual machine.

VMware Fusion Pro now shows the status of each virtual machine in the library list view. This is particularly useful for power users working with many virtual machines.

Improved support for Retina displays, including changes to Unity mode and the ability to control how Fusion scales when moving between Retina-class and standard density displays.

Direct sounds from virtual machines to a specific audio device on your Mac.

Per-virtual machine shortcut keys make jumping quickly between operating systems a breeze.

Improved support for Linux in virtual machines including CentOS 7 and RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.

The ability to access virtual machines running on VMware vSphere, VMware ESXi, and VMware Workstation directly from VMware Fusion Pro including:

Remote display, keyboard, and mouse control
Ability to select media for CD, DVD, floppy devices, including files on your Mac
Ability to power virtual machines on and off and configure the network they connect to
Ability to move virtual machines from your Mac to a remote location by dragging and dropping
Ability to move virtual machines from a remote location to your Mac by dragging and dropping
See the state of your remote server with at-a-glance health summary based on Activity Monitor


Known Issues
The following issues might occur in VMware Fusion 7.0.

OS X Yosemite is not yet final.
Late breaking changes might affect compatibility with the final version of OS X Yosemite.

3D acceleration is not provided for Mac OS X operating systems inside a virtual machine.
This prevents the use of some features that rely on 3D capabilities.

Windows 8 always uses the discrete GPU even when GPU auto-switching is enabled.
To optimize for better battery life in Windows 8, select “Don’t Use High Performance Graphics (Longer Battery Life)” in the Display settings panel. (This option is only available on laptops with both an integrated and discrete GPU.)

Entering Unity on Windows XP with “Use full resolution for Retina display” enabled might fail and revert to Single Window. 
Workaround: Do not select “Use full resolution for Retina display.” Instead, downgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 10 in the Compatibility settings panel.
Windows XP displays black side bars in full screen mode on monitors wider than 2560 pixels when “Use full resolution for Retina display” is enabled. 
Workaround: To avoid this issue, either disable “Use full resolution for Retina display” or downgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 10 in the Compatibility settings panel.
Entering Unity or Full Screen might fail.
Entering Unity or Full Screen might fail and revert to Single Window when “Use full resolution for Retina display” is enabled when there is a low DPI monitor larger than 2048 pixels wide attached. Affected monitors include the Apple 27” and 30” Cinema Displays.
Workaround: To avoid this issue, disable “Use full resolution for Retina display.”

On some hardware, an OS X virtual machine upgraded to 10.9.3 fails to boot.
Workaround: Create a new OS X virtual machine with 10.9.3 and transfer your data.

Drag and drop might fail with two or more running virtual machines in Unity mode.
Workaround: Reduce the number of virtual machines running in Unity mode by suspending or exiting Unity mode on other machines.
When running a Fedora 20 virtual machine in full screen, the display might use an incorrect resolution.
Workaround: Uninstall and reinstall the latest version of VMware Tools.
For restricted virtual machines configured to verify time with a server, the warning message displayed when the server is not available shows an incorrect time remaining.
In some cases, a remote virtual machine’s CD drive disables itself when connected to a local image.
Workaround: Upload the image to the remote datastore and connect to the image there.
A USB webcam might fail to connect when used with the virtual camera device in a Windows 7 or OSX virtual machine.
Workaround: Connect the camera to the virtual machine with USB. By default, cameras do not appear in the USB devices list. To show them, edit the file ~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/config (It is a text file; create it if needed.) and add the line: 
vusbcamera.passthrough = “TRUE”
Quit and restart Fusion. Then select the camera to pass to the virtual machine in the USB settings panel.
Disabling “Connect At Power On” option in the Network Adaptor setting panel on a powered off remote virtual machine might revert to the enabled state.
Workaround: Power the virtual machine on and then disable the option.
Open VMware Tools included in some recent versions of Linux, such as CentOS 7, might prevent file sharing (HGFS), drag-and-drop, or cut and paste from working correctly.
Workaround: Uninstall the open-vm-tools package and install the latest version of the included VMware Tools.
Occasionally, the UI performance of a Yosemite virtual machine is poor with slow window and menu updates
Expanding a virtual hard drive connected to a remote virtual machine fails with a warning of "A specified parameter was not correct."
Workaround: Create a new virtual hard drive in the desired size, copy the files, and then remove the old virtual hard drive.
Removing a virtual hard drive from a remote virtual machine fails without an error or warning.
This is a known limitation of remote virtual machines with snapshots. To remove the drive, delete all snapshots.
There can be a significant delay between selecting the “Install McAfee AntiVirus Plus” menu item and the installation CD appearing in the virtual machine.
Occasionally, changing the scaled resolution option in the Display settings panel with a running virtual machine results in incorrect mouse positioning or incorrect scaling.
Workaround: To avoid this issue, shutdown the virtual machine before adjusting the scaled resolution option.
In some circumstances, when entering Unity on a multi-monitor configuration, the window contents show as gray rectangles instead of correct content.
Interacting with the window causes the content to update to the correct state.
For some multi-monitor configurations, scaled full screen view mode fails to display correctly.
Scaled full screen mode sometimes does not work well with Ubuntu 14.04.1.
Switching a virtual machine to Unity mode on a MacBook Pro with Retina display and two external displays, the virtual machine enters into Unity mode but displays flashing window content.
To exit the state, leave Unity mode. To prevent recurrence, disconnect one of the external displays or disable the “Use full resolution for Retina display” checkbox in the Display settings panel.
With “Use full resolution for Retina display” enabled or when running on Yosemite preview builds, Unity windows might not display correctly in Expose.
When running on Yosemite preview builds, changing the full screen mode option from “Use Single Display in Full Screen” to “Use All Displays in Full Screen” while in full screen mode can fail with some monitors displaying black.
Workaround: To resolve the issue, exit and re-enter full screen mode.
In some cases on Windows 8.1, the PC Migration Agent does not automatically launch after restarting the PC to be imported.
Workaround: If this occurs, locate and launch the PC Migration Agent manually.
A Windows XP virtual machine cannot be set to a resolution larger than 2560 x 1920.
To avoid this issue, downgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 10 in the Compatibility settings panel.
When running an OS X virtual machine with a shared folder mapped to a folder on a server, opening .dmg files already open by another application fails with the message “The following disk image couldn't be opened - Reason Input/Output error.”
Workaround: Ensure that the files are not open from another application or copy the files to a local folder and share that with the virtual machine.
Dragging and dropping a file from the guest to a host folder with a large number of non-ASCII characters in the folder or path name can crash the guest OS.
Workaround: This can be avoided by renaming the folder and parent folders so that they have less than 58 non-ASCII characters total in their names.
With three monitors connected and “Use full resolution for Retina Display” enabled, entering Unity can fail either by reverting to single window mode or extended display flicker. 
Workaround: To prevent this, either remove a display or disable “Use full resolution for Retina Display.”
With three monitors connected, “Use full resolution for Retina Display” enabled and scaled resolution enabled for Full Screen, entering Full Screen can fail either by reverting to single window mode or mirroring a single display across the monitors. 
To prevent this, either remove a display, disable “Use full resolution for Retina Display,” or disable scaled resolution enabled for Full Screen.
Sending a file over Bluetooth can fail if the “Share Bluetooth devices with Windows” checkbox has been disabled and re-enabled without rebooting the virtual machine. 
Workaround: Reboot the virtual machine.
When prompted for the admin password after downloading VMware Tools or McAfee AntiVirus Plus, if you click into a virtual machine window, the mouse cursor might disappear or lock up. 
To exit this state, press Command-Tab to switch to another application, and then Command-Tab again until you switch back to VMware Fusion.
In some Linux virtual machines, changing the networking type from NAT to bridged (or visa versa) can fail to reset networking stack and result in stale networking information, including the IP address.
Workaround: Disconnect and reconnect the network adaptor by disabling and re-enabling the “Connect Network Adaptor” check box in the Network Adaptor settings pane.
When connected to an instance of VMware Workstation hosting remote virtual machines, the status pane shows 0 RAM and CPU usage.
While running Fusion on Yosemite pre-release builds, changing values in the “Default Applications” panel in settings might appear to fail. 
Pressing “Show All” and then returning to the “Default Applications” panel refreshes the values shown.
When running a Debian 6 virtual machine in Unity, window dragging might fail. 
Workaround: Exit Unity and use the virtual machine in Full Screen or single window mode.
Copying files from a USB 3 flash drive connected to an OS X virtual machine with a USB 3.0 controller can fail and cause the flash drive to connect from both the virtual machine and host. 
To avoid this, connect the flash drive to the host and then map the drive into the virtual machine with folder sharing.
With some Linux virtual machines, suspending a virtual machine might fail with the error “The request to Suspend this virtual machine failed because the corresponding VMware Tools script did not run successfully.” 
Workaround: Uninstalling and then reinstalling the tools might resolve this issue.
Some USB WiFi adaptors might fail to reconnect after sleeping and resuming the host machine.
Workaround: Unplugging and re-inserting the adaptor might resolve this issue.
Screen updates of Office 2013 applications might be slow.
Checking the “Disable hardware graphics acceleration” checkbox in Options for each application might improve performance.
Enlarging a virtual hard disk on a remote virtual machine fails.
This operation is not supported on remote virtual machines. To add more drive space, create a new hard disk of the desired size, copy the files, and then remove the old disk.
Easy install for some Linux distributions fails if the virtual machine’s name includes $0.
Workaround: Do not include $0 in the virtual machine’s name.
Audio and video quality when using video conferencing from within a virtual machine might be poor.
Workaround: Using a headset might mitigate the audio issue.
Exporting a virtual machine to OVF or OVA fails when specifying a really long file name or a file name that includes non-alpha numeric characters. 
Workaround: To avoid the issue, chose a name shorter than 240 characters with only letters, numbers, and spaces.
Using a USB headset with a virtual machine with a USB 3 controller can fail. 
Workaround: Reconfiguring the USB controller to a USB 2 controller in the “Advanced USB Options” in the USB and Bluetooth settings panel might resolve this issue.
After sleeping and awakening the host Mac, guest audio might fail with an error message “”. 
Workaround: Suspending and resuming the virtual machine might restore the audio.
Shared folders in a running OS X virtual machine might fail to copy files with the error “The item <file_name> can't be copied because there isn't enough free space.” 
Workaround: Rebooting the virtual machine without changing the Shared Folder settings should resolve this issue.
When creating a virtual machine with a name that includes accented characters, the Removable Devices section of the Settings window might not be visible.
Workaround: Quitting and restarting Fusion resolves this issue.
Some applications fail to launch from a Unity docker or the Fusion application menu.
The applications launch correctly from the Windows Start Menu or by double clicking on the application within Windows.
On some remote virtual machines, the Shut Down option is disabled.
Workaround: To power off the virtual machine, press the Option key and select “Force Shutdown.”
Remote virtual machines do not automatically resize the virtual machine’s video when going into Full Screen or when the window is resized.
Workaround: To resize the virtual machine’s video, use the UI within the virtual machine’s operating system.
When operating with multiple versions of Fusion installed, you might see an issue where starting a virtual machine fails with an “Internal Error.” 
This issue can be resolved by restarting the Mac.
Cutting and pasting a file from the Mac into Outlook running in a Windows virtual machine can fail.
Workaround: This can be avoided by pasting the file onto the Windows desktop and then attaching it to the email within Outlook.
Running a virtual machine stored on an external NTFS formatted volume fails with a non-specific error.
Workaround: Moving the virtual machine to an HFS formatted volume avoids this error.
Some UI elements in Adobe Photoshop might not render correctly when running within a OS X virtual machine. 
Workaround: This can be remedied by disabling the virtual machine’s accelerated video driver. To do so, open the Terminal application inside the virtual machine and type:
sudo nvram boot-args='vmw_gfx_caps=0'
Press return and enter the virtual machine’s admin password. Then reboot the virtual machine.
Connecting a USB 3 device to a USB 3 hub while Fusion is running might not show the device to either the Mac or the virtual machine.
Workaround: To avoid this, plug the device directly into the Mac.
When passed through to a virtual machine, some USB devices, such as iPads and iPhones, might not recharge their batteries.

The installation media for VMware Fusion have been simplified. Simply launch the VMware Fusion.app from the media or download file to install and upgrade VMware Fusion. Dragging and dropping, then launching VMware Fusion.app is also supported.

VMware Fusion can be uninstalled by quitting the application and dragging it to the trash.

Designed for Mountain Lion

VMware Fusion 5 was designed with OS X Mountain Lion in mind to give users a more Mac-like experience in running Windows programs on a Mac. Search your favorite Windows programs in Launchpad or use "AirPlay Mirroring" to stream your Mac and Windows applications on your HDTV. VMware Fusion uses Mountain Lion's notification center to display important messages. VMware Fusion 5 also works with OS X Lion and Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.7 required.)

Windows 8 Optimized

Who said Windows 8 was for PCs? Get the most out of the new Windows 8-style "Metro" applications using VMware Fusion 5 and Mountain Lion full-screen mode.

VMware Fusion 5 has been optimized to take advantage of new Windows 8 technologies and will make you wonder why you would ever consider running Windows 8 on anything other than a Mac. VMware Fusion supports Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Enterprise and includes a keyboard profile tailored for Windows 8.

VMware Fusion 5 also supports running Windows 8 from a Boot Camp partition.

Optimized for the latest Macs

Get the benefits of your new Mac with your Windows programs too. Crisp and detailed Windows applications like you've never seen before with Retina Display support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.

Extend your Mac's connectivity to your Windows environment and take advantage of USB 3.0 support when used with Windows 8 and recent versions of Linux with USB 3.0 support.

VMware Fusion 5 takes advantage of faster memory and faster SSD performance found in the latest Macs to deliver an experience that feels as fast as native. VMware Fusion 5 has been tuned to feel snappier and more responsive even on older Macs.

VMware Fusion 5 has been updated to provide longer battery life, particularly when the virtual machine is being lightly used.

User Interface Changes

The VMware Fusion 5 user interface has been refined to provide a more productive working environment that works well with OSX Mountain Lion. The changes include:

New Virtual Machine Library, updated with a choice of both icon and list views appropriate for small laptop displays and large desktop configurations. Both with active thumbnail displays.
The ability to create folders within the library to organize large collections of virtual machines.
See disk utilization and other key information directly from the virtual machine library, easing day-to-day management especially on space constrained SSD-based systems.
New handling of Settings and Snapshot windows making it easier to make tweaks and changes while continuing to work in the virtual machine.
New take and restore snapshot buttons can optionally be added to the virtual machine tool bar, making working with snapshots much more efficient.
The redesigned Welcome experience makes it easier for new users to get up and running.
The VMware Fusion Learning Center can now be accessed directly from VMware Fusion and has been updated with new video content for this release.
Virtual Hardware Changes

Known Issues

The following issues might occur in VMware Fusion 5.0.

When importing the Boot Camp partition to a virtual machine, an error message appears
When you import the Boot Camp partition to a virtual machine, you receive the error message VMware Fusion is unable to prepare your virtual machine. This problem occurs when Fusion is unable to apply settings to the Windows registry needed to run the imported Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.

When saving documents to a FAT32 format drive in Office 2010, a Directory in Use error is seen
A Directory in Use error is received when saving documents to a FAT32 format drive (through Shared Folders) in Office 2010. This occurs when you are using Office applications to create and save files to shared folders. This usually occurs with externally attached drives, such as a USB drive. This also occurs with Microsoft SMB shares to that same location when used by Office from a remote Windows PC.

Workaround: Use the Office application to save and create files to a share located on the host internal drive or any drive not formatted for FAT, for example, Mac OS Extended (using Finder Get Info on the volume). Then copy the resulting file to the FAT drive.

Virtual machine view mode might not revert from snapshot
If you take a virtual machine snapshot in one view mode (Single Window/Unity/Full Screen) and switch to another view mode, the virtual machine view might not revert from snapshot. While the virtual machine restores the snapshot, the view mode may not revert to the original mode.

Workaround: Use the Fusion Menu or shortcuts to change the view mode manually.

Unable to boot a virtual machine from some USB 3.0 devices on MacBook Air 5.1
You might be unable to boot a virtual machine from some USB 3.0 devices on MacBook Air 5.1.
When attaching a USB 3.0 device, you might see the error message The device 'XXX' was unable to connect to its ideal host controller. An attempt will be made to connect this device to the available host controller. This might result in undefined behavior for this device.

You can ignore the error message and finish installing the guest OS on the USB device. However, after restarting the virtual machine, the USB 3.0 device does not show up on the Boot Menu.

Workaround: Use a USB 2.0 device as a replacement.

Cannot install the complimentary McAfee Anti-Virus software on Windows 8
The bundled McAfee Anti-Virus introductory subscription cannot be installed on Windows 8. The Install McAfee Anti-Virus Plus menu item is not available. The McAfee installer bundled with VMware Fusion 5 does not support Windows 8 and does not install on this version of Microsoft Windows.

Workaround: If you require Anti-Virus protection, you can use an alternative anti-virus product that supports Windows 8.

NetBooted Mac OS X guest might fail to reboot
A NetBooted Mac OS X guest can fail to boot from the network when the guest OS is restarted.

Workaround: A cold start of the virtual machine is required to reinitialize the virtual Ethernet adapter.

Unity mode not available for certain Linux desktops
When you power on any guest using the Ubuntu Unity desktop environment (Ubuntu 11.10+), the Unity menu and Unity tool bar appears disabled. Unity is also disabled for guests using Compiz and Enlightenment window managers.

There are miscolored graphics on Windows 8 welcome screen running on a Retina display equipped Mac in Full Screen mode
In certain configurations the login screen might be overlaid on the welcome screen, resulting in incorrect colors. Once you begin the login process, the colors will appear correctly.

Elements of the Windows 8-style application mode are not available in Windows 8
Certain features of Windows 8-style applications (formerly Metro) are not available when in Unity mode (e.g. charms menu).

Workaround: Switch to single-window mode or full-screen mode to access these features.

Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications does not work correctly with Windows 8
Software can no longer programmatically set URL handlers in Windows 8.

Workaround: Associate http and https with VMwareHostOpen.exe using the Windows Control Panel.

OS X virtual machines are limited to a 16MB video frame buffer
This limits the maximum resolution of OS X in a virtual machine to approximately 2560x1600.

Creating a custom virtual network with mismatched IP address and net mask may result in an unusable virtual network. 
Improved validation will be included in a future release of VMware Fusion.

Preview versions of Microsoft Office 2013 might experience graphics rendering issues when running in a virtual machine
When a video card is set to enable 3D acceleration, Microsoft Office 2013 applications fail to correctly render graphics.

Workaround: Disable 3D acceleration.

While a Linux virtual machine is in Unity mode, the Tools service stops working after Mission Control operations
When a Linux virtual machine runs in Unity mode, the mission control operations (such as show Mission Control, Application windows, Desktop, and Dashboard view) causes the Tools service in the virtual machine to stop working. With Tools functionaly no longer available, the virtual machine cannot, for example, auto-fit its resolution after resizing the virtual machine window, and files cannot be dragged and dropped between the host and the guest. This problem is known to occur on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.3, openSUSE12.1, Ubuntu 11.10 virtual machines, and might occur on virtual machines with other Linux distributions installed.

Workaround: Restart the virtual machine.

While uninstalling the Windows 8 guest operating system tools, you encounter a black screen on the virtual machine
When you uninstall the Windows 8 guest operation system tools, you might encounter a black screen on the virtual machine. This is due to a driver issue.

Workaround: Wait a few minutes for the display to recover. The uninstallation of the tools should be successful once the display recoveres and should prompt you for a restart of the virtual machine.

Suspending and resuming a virtual machine while installing McAfee VirusScan Plus causes the McAfee installation to fail and causes the Tools installer to launch unexpectedly
On a Windows virtual machine, when installing McAfee VirusScan Plus, if you suspend and then resume the virtual machine while the installation wizard for McAfee is open, the installation of McAfee cannot continue and the Tools installer launches. This occurs because the the McAfee installer ISO image is incorrectly unmounted and the Tools installer ISO image is mounted instead.

Workaround: Cancel the Tools installation and restart the virtual machine.

The Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications virtual machine setting is not supported in Windows 8
The Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications setting in the virtual machine Default Application settings is not supported for Windows 8 guest operating systems. If in Fusion you set Virtual Machine > Settings > Default Applications > Open weblinks in guest using Mac applications and then open a Windows 8 virtual machine, the setting does not change Windows 8 settings and weblinks are opened by the default application in Windows 8.

Workaround: In Windows 8, open Default Programs > Set Default Programs and select Default Host Application. Click Choose default associations to manually set which file types the host should open.

Empty the Trash.
Restart VMware Fusion.
It might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.

Guest Operating Systems

When upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.
Workaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at "Migrating OD to 10.7", perform the following steps:
Press Cmd-Q in the guest and click the "Shut Down" button.
Add a second processor core to the virtual machine.
The guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.

When configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.
Workaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.
Bootcamp

Hibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.

Accessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder

When Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.
Workaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.
Using Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.
Workaround: None.
If you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.
Workaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.
If you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.
Workaround: None.
Graphics

Adding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.
Workaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.
Autodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.

Updates in VMware Fusion 4.1

VMware Fusion 4.1 is a free, minor upgrade recommended for all users of VMware Fusion 4. This release includes the following new features and improvements.

Smart Full Screen

Full screen mode provides better productivity and consistency with Mac OS X Lion than previous versions.

The Lion full-screen button is used in virtual machine windows.
The Lion full-screen keyboard shortcut (Cmd-Control-F) is now supported in addition to Cmd-Control-Return.
Like other full screen Lion applications, a VMware Fusion virtual machine moves to a new full screen space when using a single display.
If you are using multiple displays, VMware Fusion intelligently decides whether to use a full screen space or not. If the virtual machine is configured to use all displays in full screen, it moves to a full screen space. If not, full screen takes the whole display in the current space, which enables you to work in other Mac applications while the virtual machine makes full use of the secondary display.
The VMware Fusion menu bar and toolbar are now accessible from Full Screen mode. A short delay in showing the menu allows access the top of the virtual machine screen, particularly when running Mac OS X Lion in a virtual machine.
A redesigned, compact minibar that you can drag for quick access to common actions without leaving Full Screen mode.
Automatic virtual machine power on

Virtual machines can now be powered on automatically when VMware Fusion starts. You can override this setting by holding Shift when VMware Fusion starts. This feature was removed in VMware Fusion 4 but is now available in VMware Fusion 4.1 in the General settings for every virtual machine.

Improved animations

Improved animations for full screen mode, unity mode, library and snapshots.

Fast screen resizing and improved startup time

Faster screen resizing (Microsoft Hotfix 2522761 recommended), faster transitions into Unity and Full Screen modes, and improved startup time with Windows 7 virtual machines.

Improved Mac OS X Lion guest operating system support

Improved Mac OS X Lion virtual machine support including smoother mouse movements and support for File Vault 2 when using Mac OS X 10.7.2 or later. Upated VMware Tools disable sleep on older versions of Mac OS X virtual machines.

Improved graphics performance

Improved graphics performance and correctness for Internet Explorer 9 and Solidworks 2012 and improved graphics performance when using Mac OS X 10.7.2.

VMware Fusion 4.1 also resolves the following issues:

An intermittent problem when plugging in a new USB device that resulted in error 4.
Improved support for resizing NTFS formatted disks.
An intermittent issue connecting USB devices attached via a Thunderbolt display.
An intermittent issue installing Mac OS X Lion from physical media.
Improved compatibility of shared folders for many applications.
An issue installing VMware Tools on Ubuntu 11.10 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7.
A graphics rendering issue on some Mac Pro systems with very large amounts of memory
A graphics rendering issue specific to some non-English languages.
An intermittent problem when using the migration assistant on Mac OS X 10.7.2.
Spurious activation messages when using Boot Camp virtual machines on some systems.

Installation Notes

The hardware requirements to run this version of VMware Fusion have changed since VMware Fusion 3.0. This version of VMware Fusion requires a 64-bit CPU. Macs containing Intel Core Solo and Core Duo processors are no longer supported. Mac OS X 10.6.7 or higher is required to use VMware Fusion. See the system requirements in Getting Started with VMware Fusion for more details.

Install VMware Fusion 4.1 by dragging the VMware Fusion application icon to a folder on your Mac. The VMware Fusion application can be dragged to the Applications folder or to another location on your Mac. If you are running a previous version of VMware Fusion, double-click the Upgrade icon instead of dragging the application icon.

VMware Tools Installation

All users should upgrade VMware Tools after installing VMware Fusion 4.1 to obtain all the fixes in this release.

In order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion "light" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.

If you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).

McAfee VirusScan for Mac

If you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.

To prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.

On your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.
Click Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.
Click More Options.
Select Click lock to make changes.

PC Migration Notes

For some best practices and troubleshooting information, see "Migration Assistant: A Guide" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.

VMware Fusion Migrate Your PC

The Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7 Lion.

The VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.

Before migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.
In the Control Panel, click Power Options.
On the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.
Before migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.
The Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.

If you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.
The simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.

Right-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.
Select the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.
You must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.
If you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.
Workaround: Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.

Migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.
After migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.
Start the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.
Download a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).
Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.
Tools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.

Mac OS X Lion and Mac OS X Lion Server are now supported as guest operating systems. Mac OS X Lion can be installed by dragging the Lion installer icon to the virtual machine wizard.

Virtual Hardware Improvements

As always, VMware continues to improve our virtual hardware performance and capabilities. You must upgrade the hardware version of your existing VMs or create a new VM in order to get the best features and performance from your virtual machines. Upgrade the hardware version of your virtual machine from the new virtual machine settings page under Compatibility.

An HD Audio device is available for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and OS X 10.7 guests. The new HD Audio device takes advantage of the latest sound drivers and produces high sound quality even under heavy load.

Bluetooth devices on the host can now be shared with Windows and Mac OS X guests. Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth phone, are paired to either the host system or to a virtual machine. VMware does not recommend pairing Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones, or Bluetooth input devices, such as keyboards and mice to a guest.

Link-state propagation enables applications to seamlessly communicate when using NAT-based networking even when moving between networks. For example, communication between applications will continue seamlessly when you move from a wired network to a wireless network.

Our graphics team continues to improve rendering correctness and to tune our graphics drivers. VMware Fusion 4 is up to 2.5 times faster than VMware Fusion 3 for some 3D operations. Improved support for AutoCAD, SolidWorks and Altium Designer on Windows XP and Windows 7 is also included.

Encrypted Virtual Machines

VMware Fusion now enables security best practices by providing virtual disk encryption using industry-standard AES-128. Encryption can require a per-virtual-machine password whenever the virtual machine is powered on.

Pause State for Virtual Machines

The new Pause state suspends the virtual machine while retaining the in-memory state. This state can be useful when system resources will temporarily be taxed and the guest virtual machine is not immediately needed.

Remote CD and DVD Drives

Remote CD and DVD drives shared from another Windows PC or Mac are supported for installing operating systems on virtual machines.

Shrinking Disks with Snapshots

VMware Fusion now supports shrinking virtual disks without the need to remove the snapshots first. Shrinking virtual disks without removing snapshots allows users to maintain their virtual machines and reclaim disk space more easily than in previous releases of VMware Fusion. Look for the new virtual machine clean up capability under the General section of the virtual machine settings.

Mirrored Folders

Downloads and Movies folders are now mirrored from the Mac.

OVF Support

Support for creating OVF-format virtual machines is provided by the standalone OVF tool. This tool is available for download from: http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/server/vsphere/automationtools/ovf?view=overview

Other Technical Changes

VMware Fusion 4 is now 64-bit throughout. In addition, services and kernel extensions are loaded and unloaded on-demand. The application can now be run from non-standard folder locations. The PC Migration Wizard has been updated to provide even faster migration.

Updates in VMware Fusion 4.0.2

VMware Fusion 4.0.2 addresses an issue starting virtual machines running a forthcoming version of Mac OS X Lion.

PC Migration Notes

For some best practices and troubleshooting information, see "Migration Assistant: A Guide" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.

VMware Fusion Migrate Your PC

The Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7.1 Lion.

The VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.

Before migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.
In the Control Panel, click Power Options.
On the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.
Before migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.
The Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.

If you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.
The simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.

Right-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.
Select the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.
You must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.
If you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.
Workaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.

Migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.
After migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.
Start the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.
Download a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).
Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.
Tools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.

Empty the Trash.
Restart VMware Fusion.
It might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.

Guest Operating Systems

When upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.
Workaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at "Migrating OD to 10.7", perform the following steps:
Press Cmd-Q in the guest and click the "Shut Down" button.
Add a second processor core to the virtual machine.
The guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.

When configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.
Workaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.
Bootcamp

Hibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.
Workaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\plugins\vmsvc.
Accessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder

When Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.
Workaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.
Using Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.
Workaround: None.
If you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.
Workaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.
If you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.
Workaround: None.
Graphics

Adding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.
Workaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.
Autodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.
Workaround: Try any of the following setting changes.
Change Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).
Change Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.
Change the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.
Graphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.
Workaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.
In Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.
Workaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.
Graphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.
Workaround: None.
Some older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.
Workaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.
Some applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.
Workaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.
Folders

If a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.
Workaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.
In a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. 
Workaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.
Virtual Machine View Modes

The application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.
Workaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.
In Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.
Workaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.
Switching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.
Workaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.
If you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.
Workaround: None.
Virtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.
Workaround: None.
Hiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.
Workaround: None.
Network Configuration

In a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.
Workaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.
On a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.
Workaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.
Virtual Machine Power States

If you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.
Workaround: None.
VMware Fusion User Interface

If CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.
Workaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.
You can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.
Workaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.
Localization

The VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.
Workaround:
Remove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:
com.apple.help.plist
com.apple.helpui.plist
com.apple.helpviewer.plist
Remove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:
com.apple.helpui folder
com.apple.helpdata
Empty the Trash.
Reboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.
Removable Devices

If you change the default system sound output device while VMware Fusion is running, any virtual machines started or resumed after that point use the previous default sound device. Changing the default sound output device while a virtual machine is running will switch to that sound device only until the virtual machine is shut down or suspended.
Workaround: Restart VMware Fusion after changing the default sound output device.
European keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences. Sending keys such as @, {, }, and others to Windows does not work as it does on the Mac.
Workaround: Only German and French keyboards are supported.
If you use a USB headset connected from the host to the guest, you will hear some glitches.
Workaround: None.
Printing multiple copies of a document from the guest on a USB printer that is connected to the host does not work. If you attempt to print multiple copies from a guest on a USB printer, only one copy is printed.
Workaround: Connect the USB printer to the guest directly. Alternatively, connect the printer to the host using network mode.

PC Migration Notes

For some best practices and troubleshooting information, see "Migration Assistant: A Guide" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.

VMware Fusion Migrate Your PC

The Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7.1 Lion.

The VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.

Before migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.
In the Control Panel, click Power Options.
On the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.
Before migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.
The Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.

If you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.
The simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.

Right-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.
Select the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.
You must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.
If you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.
Workaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.

Migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.
After migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.
Start the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.
Download a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).
Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.
Tools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.

Change Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.
Change the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.
Graphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.
Workaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.
In Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.
Workaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.
Graphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.
Workaround: None.
Some older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.
Workaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.
Some applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.
Workaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.
Folders

If a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.
Workaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.
In a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. 
Workaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.
Virtual Machine View Modes

Workaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.
Switching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.
Workaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.
If you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.
Workaround: None.
Virtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.
Workaround: None.
Hiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.
Workaround: None.
Network Configuration

In a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.
Workaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.
On a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.
Workaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.
Virtual Machine Power States

If you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.
Workaround: None.
VMware Fusion User Interface

If CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.
Workaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.
You can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.
Workaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.
Localization

The VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.
Workaround:
Remove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:
com.apple.help.plist
com.apple.helpui.plist
com.apple.helpviewer.plist
Remove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:
com.apple.helpui folder
com.apple.helpdata
Empty the Trash.
Reboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.
Removable Devices

If you change the default system sound output device while VMware Fusion is running, any virtual machines started or resumed after that point use the previous default sound device. Changing the default sound output device while a virtual machine is running will switch to that sound device only until the virtual machine is shut down or suspended.
Workaround: Restart VMware Fusion after changing the default sound output device.
European keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences. Sending keys such as @, {, }, and others to Windows does not work as it does on the Mac.
Workaround: Only German and French keyboards are supported.
If you use a USB headset connected from the host to the guest, you will hear some glitches.
Workaround: None.
Printing multiple copies of a document from the guest on a USB printer that is connected to the host does not work. If you attempt to print multiple copies from a guest on a USB printer, only one copy is printed.
Workaround: Connect the USB printer to the guest directly. Alternatively, connect the printer to the host using network mode.

What's New

This release of VMware Fusion adds the following new features.

New Installation Experience
New User Interface
Designed for Lion
Virtual Hardware Improvements
Encrypted Virtual Machines
Pause State for Virtual Machines
Remote CD and DVD Drives
Shrinking Disks with Snapshots
Mirrored Folders
OVF Support
Other Technical Changes
New Installation Experience

VMware Fusion is now installed by dragging and dropping to the Applications folder. Users of older versions can upgrade using the included utility. VMware Fusion can be uninstalled by quitting the application and dragging it to the trash.

New User Interface

VMware Fusion includes a new user interface designed to maximize screen space dedicated to running virtual machines. By keeping the interface minimal, we have improved user productivity for Windows applications. It is now more consistent with the overall Mac desktop experience than previous versions of VMware Fusion.

The new user interface includes the following key features.

The Single-window experience is optimized around each running virtual machine, keeping related options and settings together. A new collapsible toolbar provides quick access to common virtual machine actions including switching networks, connecting and disconnecting devices, and sharing options. The Control-Alt-Delete key combination is now available as a menu button.
The Virtual Machine Library Welcome screen has been refreshed to make it easier to get up and running quickly.
The Virtual Machine Library is updated with thumbnails of virtual machine desktops and shortcuts to common activities.
The Settings have been redesigned to make it easier to perform common tasks. New settings subsections for Compatibility, Default Applications and Startup Disk are included.
The Snapshot viewer provides powerful new features for working with snapshots using a timeline-based view, inspired by Time Machine.
Designed for Lion

VMware Fusion 4 is designed for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and includes support for using Mission Control to switch between Mac and Windows applications. Support for Spaces and Exposé has also been improved to make it easier to switch between applications.

Mac OS X Lion and Mac OS X Lion Server are now supported as guest operating systems. Mac OS X Lion can be installed by dragging the Lion installer icon to the virtual machine wizard.

Virtual Hardware Improvements

As always, VMware continues to improve our virtual hardware performance and capabilities. You must upgrade the hardware version of your existing VMs or create a new VM in order to get the best features and performance from your virtual machines. Upgrade the hardware version of your virtual machine from the new virtual machine settings page under Compatibility.

An HD Audio device is available for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and OS X 10.7 guests. The new HD Audio device takes advantage of the latest sound drivers and produces high sound quality even under heavy load.

Bluetooth devices on the host can now be shared with Windows and Mac OS X guests. Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth phone, are paired to either the host system or to a virtual machine. VMware does not recommend pairing Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones, or Bluetooth input devices, such as keyboards and mice to a guest.

Link-state propagation enables applications to seamlessly communicate when using NAT-based networking even when moving between networks. For example, communication between applications will continue seamlessly when you move from a wired network to a wireless network.

Our graphics team continues to improve rendering correctness and to tune our graphics drivers. VMware Fusion 4 is up to 2.5 times faster than VMware Fusion 3 for some 3D operations. Improved support for AutoCAD, SolidWorks and Altium Designer on Windows XP and Windows 7 is also included.

Encrypted Virtual Machines

VMware Fusion now enables security best practices by providing virtual disk encryption using industry-standard AES-128. Encryption can require a per-virtual-machine password whenever the virtual machine is powered on.

Pause State for Virtual Machines

The new Pause state suspends the virtual machine while retaining the in-memory state. This state can be useful when system resources will temporarily be taxed and the guest virtual machine is not immediately needed.

Remote CD and DVD Drives

Remote CD and DVD drives shared from another Windows PC or Mac are supported for installing operating systems on virtual machines.

Shrinking Disks with Snapshots

VMware Fusion now supports shrinking virtual disks without the need to remove the snapshots first. Shrinking virtual disks without removing snapshots allows users to maintain their virtual machines and reclaim disk space more easily than in previous releases of VMware Fusion. Look for the new virtual machine clean up capability under the General section of the virtual machine settings.

Mirrored Folders

Downloads and Movies folders are now mirrored from the Mac.

OVF Support

Support for creating OVF-format virtual machines is provided by the standalone OVF tool. This tool is available for download from: http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/server/vsphere/automationtools/ovf?view=overview

Other Technical Changes

VMware Fusion 4 is now 64-bit throughout. In addition, services and kernel extensions are loaded and unloaded on-demand. The application can now be run from non-standard folder locations. The PC Migration Wizard has been updated to provide even faster migration.

PC Migration Notes

For some best practices and troubleshooting information, see "Migration Assistant: A Guide" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.

VMware Fusion Migrate Your PC

The Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7 SP1. You can migrate PCs to Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or OS X 10.7.1 Lion.

The VMware Fusion Migration Assistant must be installed on the source PC. The Migration Agent is installer is included on the Fusion 4.0 installation DVD. If you do not have the DVD, you can download it from the VMware Web site. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.

Before migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.
In the Control Panel, click Power Options.
On the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.
Before migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.
The Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.

If you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.
The simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.

Right-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.
Select the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.
You must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.
If you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.
Workaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.

Migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.
After migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.
Start the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.
Download a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).
Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.
Tools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.

VMware Fusion Installation and Upgrade

Starting VMware Fusion with the command vmrun does not work for the first time after installation.
Workaround: Double-click the VMware Fusion .app file to start VMware Fusion for the first time. You will be prompted for your system password the first time you run VMware Fusion. vmrun can be used to start VMware Fusion after that.
The McAfee Antivirus .iso is removed during AutoUpdate of VMware Fusion if no newer version of the .iso is available.
Workaround: Download the McAfee Antivirus .iso.
If you installed the VMware Fusion April 2011 Beta or the VMware Fusion June 2011 Beta and then installed VMware Fusion 4.0, the VMware Fusion Help might not display when you click context-sensitive help links from the Fusion user interface.
Workaround: Clear the cache for the Help files.
Delete the following files:
$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*
$HOME⁄Library⁄Caches⁄com.apple.help*
Empty the Trash.
Restart VMware Fusion.
It might take a few minutes for the VMware Fusion Help index to rebuild.

Guest Operating Systems

When upgrading a Mac OS X 10.6 Server guest to OS X 10.7, the upgrade process might stall while migrating the Open Directory configuration.
Workaround: Before upgrading to OS X 10.7, ensure that the virtual machine has at least two processor cores allocated to it. If Server Setup has already been launched with only one processor core and it has stalled at "Migrating OD to 10.7", perform the following steps:
Press Cmd-Q in the guest and click the "Shut Down" button.
Add a second processor core to the virtual machine.
The guest returns to the start of Server Setup the next time you boot it, and Server Setup completes successfully.

When configuring a new OS X 10.7 Server, it is possible for the process to stall while initializing the Open Directory Master.
Workaround: None. It might be necessary to create a new virtual machine and repeat the installation after the Server configuration has stalled. If a new virtual machine is necessary, ensure that the new virtual machine has at least two processor cores.
Bootcamp

Hibernation in native boot camp Windows 7 64-bit is enabled after booting into the virtual environment and then booting into the native boot camp partition.
Workaround: Remove or rename the disableGuestHibernate.dll file in the folder C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\plugins\vmsvc.
Accessing Applications from the Mac Applications Folder

When Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is enabled in settings and the application is installed in both host and guest, if you delete the host application while VMware Fusion is open, you cannot run the guest application in Unity.
Workaround: Switch to Single window mode, disable and then re-enable the setting.
Using Run Windows applications from your Mac's Application Folder is not compatible with shared virtual machine.
Workaround: None.
If you publish a windows application to the Mac /Applications folder, uninstalling the application from inside the guest will not remove the application from Mac /Applications folder.
Workaround: Log out of the guest and restart the virtual machine. Alternatively, remove the application manually.
If you move a Windows applications that has been published to the Mac /Applications folder to another folder, when you click this application at its new location, a second application in the Mac /Applications folder is created.
Workaround: None.
Graphics

Adding or removing a third or fourth monitor connected to a second graphics card on a Mac causes shared context to become invalid which can lead to a Windows virtual machine crash.
Workaround: Suspend or power off a Windows virtual machine before adding or removing a third or fourth display connected to a second graphics card.
Autodesk 3ds Max 2012 viewports might run slowly or freeze with complex scenes and multiple lights.
Workaround: Try any of the following setting changes.
Change Scene Lights to Default Lights (1 OR 2).
Change Lighting and Shadow Quality slider to Point Lights Hard Shadows or Point Lights Soft Shadows.
Change the rendering device from Nitrous to Direct3D.
Graphical distortion occurs when viewing Google Earth 6 rendering with OpenGL in a Windows XP guest.
Workaround: Switch Google Earth to render with DirectX instead of OpenGL.
In Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 or 3ds Max 2012 with Direct3D Driver enabled, the viewport might not refresh correctly when the Viewcube is enabled.
Workaround: Uncheck the Show the Viewcube option under Views › Viewcube. Alternatively, check the Show for Active View option under Views › Viewcube. For 3ds Max 2012, switch to Nitrous rendering mode.
Graphics-intensive Web sites can render very slowly if you view them in Firefox 5 or Firefox 6 in a Windows 7 or Vista guest.
Workaround: None.
Some older OpenGL games, such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, might crash in a VMware Fusion 4.0 virtual machine. The game is not able to handle the number of OpenGL extensions available since the game was released. This behavior is also seen on host systems.
Workaround: Add a new environment variable named MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR and set the value to 2003. This is a global setting, so it will need to be removed if you run any newer OpenGL applications.
Some applications might show graphical issues when running OS X 10.7 on a Mac containing an Intel X3100 graphics card.
Workaround: Uncheck the accelerated 3D option under Virtual Machine Settings › Display if you experience graphics issues.
Folders

If a folder is listed on Shared Folder Settings pane but is not checked, when you open a host file with a guest application and click Share on the Windows does not have access to the files you are trying to open dialog, the guest application cannot open the host file.
Workaround: Before opening host file with a guest application, ensure that the shared folder is checked in the Shared Folder Settings pane.
In a Windows XP virtual machine with Mirrored Folders enabled, if you log into the guest with a Limited account instead of a Computer Administrator account, the mirrored folders in the guest do not refresh automatically when there is a change in the host Desktop or Documents directory. 
Workaround: Log into a Windows XP virtual machine with a user account of Computer Administrator account type.
Virtual Machine View Modes

The application window displays a gray desktop background if you are running applications in Unity mode with Spaces turned on and then you add or remove a Space and then switch to another Space that has the Unity application open.
Workaround: Switch out of Unity view mode, and then switch back into it.
In Ubuntu 11.04 and later guests, Unity desktop is not available in the virtual machine and appears as the classic GNOME environment automatically.
Workaround: Run sudo apt-get install unity-2d in the virtual machine to install the Unity 2D desktop.
Switching to Full Screen mode in Mac OS X 10.6.7 guests and then shutting down the virtual machine will prevent the virtual machine from restarting correctly.
Workaround: If the virtual machine is a running Mac OS X 10.6.7 guest, ensure that you switch the virtual machine to Single Window mode before shutting down the virtual machine.
If you assign Linux applications in Spaces, the application window does not show up in the assigned Spaces. In addition, Linux applications do not work in Exposé.
Workaround: None.
Virtual machine cannot be suspended when in Unity mode with Show System Tray in Unity on.
Workaround: None.
Hiding an application window does not work correctly for Unity applications running in Linux guests. If you have two application windows open in Unity view mode in a Linux guest that overlap and you close one window, the contents of the closed application window still appears in the overlap area of the open application window.
Workaround: None.
Network Configuration

In a Windows Server 2008 guest, the IP address does not update when you switch from Bridged mode to NAT mode or vice versa.
Workaround: Run the ipconfig command with ⁄release and ⁄renew option. Alternatively, disable and then re-enable the network adapter.
On a Mac host running OS X 10.7, deleting a bonded adapter (also known as Link Aggregated adapter) causes the Mac host to be unresponsive. This issue does not occur on 10.6 or earlier versions of Mac OS.
Workaround: None. This issue has been reported to Apple.
Virtual Machine Power States

If you pause a virtual machine when there is audio output, the audio output continues for one to two seconds after pausing the guest.
Workaround: None.
VMware Fusion User Interface

If CD/DVD sharing is disabled on the remote host while copying a file from a remote disc inside a virtual machine, the virtual machine will crash if you click Cancel on the warning dialog.
Workaround: Click Retry and then Disconnect on the warning dialog instead of Cancel.
You can use the Key Mapping Editor to mapping any send keys. However, if you select the send keys F13, F14 and F15 from the drop-down list in the key mapping editor, they do not work well.
Workaround: Press the send keys F13, F14 and F15 manually from the keyboard instead of selecting them from the drop-down list.
Localization

The VMware Fusion Help for the Japanese version of VMware Fusion 4.0 on OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 does not display correctly and results in an error.
Workaround:
Remove the following three files in your Home > Library > Preferences folder:
com.apple.help.plist
com.apple.helpui.plist
com.apple.helpviewer.plist
Remove the following two folders in your (root) > Library > Caches folder:
com.apple.helpui folder
com.apple.helpdata
Empty the Trash.
Reboot the host and relaunch VMware Fusion.
Removable Devices

If you change the default system sound output device while VMware Fusion is running, any virtual machines started or resumed after that point use the previous default sound device. Changing the default sound output device while a virtual machine is running will switch to that sound device only until the virtual machine is shut down or suspended.
Workaround: Restart VMware Fusion after changing the default sound output device.
European keyboards are not recognized in Windows guests even when Language Specific Key Mappings is enabled in Preferences. Sending keys such as @, {, }, and others to Windows does not work as it does on the Mac.
Workaround: Only German and French keyboards are supported.
If you use a USB headset connected from the host to the guest, you will hear some glitches.
Workaround: None.
Printing multiple copies of a document from the guest on a USB printer that is connected to the host does not work. If you attempt to print multiple copies from a guest on a USB printer, only one copy is printed.
Workaround: Connect the USB printer to the guest directly. Alternatively, connect the printer to the host using network mode.

Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issues:

The Samsung Galaxy S phone with Android 2.1 is not recognized in an OS X host or in a Windows 7 guest.
Previously, to use a Logitech HD Webcam C510 in a Windows 7 virtual machine, you had to include the quirks line (Usb.quirks.device0 = "0x046d:0x081d skip-reset") as a configuration option in the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file. Now, you no longer need to include the quirks line in the .vmx file.
When you connect a Nokia N8 phone to a Windows XP guest and attempt to connect to it by using the Nokia Ovi Suite, the phone does not stay connected to the guest. The Windows Device Manager in the Windows XP guest reports This device cannot start. (Code 10).
You cannot connect USB 2.0 devices to FreeBSD guests.
When you use Suspend Guest and Resume Guest to suspend and resume an Ubuntu 10.10 guest, the network interface is down after the guest is resumed.
When you run an Nmap ("Network Mapper") scan from a virtual machine that is configured to use Network Address Translation (NAT) networking to an external Windows machine, the NAT service fails and the virtual machine has problems connecting to the external network.
You cannot use Microsoft Office 2010 in a Windows guest to open an attachment in a shared folder. The guest returns an error message that states the file is not located in a shared folder and cannot be opened by the host.
A Mac OS X Server 10.6.x virtual machine is unable to access IDE hard disks and CD/DVD drives after the guest is updated to 10.6.5 or newer. If the boot volume is on an IDE hard disk, the guest will fail to boot.
After a Windows 7 guest goes into screen saver mode, you cannot wake up the guest when you click inside the virtual machine. This problem occurs only when the following screen saver and power plan settings are selected or enabled:
In Screen Saver Settings, a screen saver is enabled, the idle time is set, and "On resume, display logon screen" is selected.
In Power Options, the Balanced plan is selected and the "Turn off the display" and "Put the computer to sleep" plan settings are set to the same timeout value as the screen saver idle time.
Previously, when you created a Mac OS X virtual machine in Fusion, the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file contained an absolute path to the virtual machine disk (.vmdk) file. This setting prevented you from copying the virtual machine because the copy pointed to the .vmdk file for the original virtual machine. Now, the .vmx file contains a relative path to the .vmdk file and you can copy Mac OS X virtual machines.
When DisplayLink drivers are installed in a Windows 7 virtual machine, the virtual machine crashes when you run it in Fusion.
Previously, when a virtual machine was configured to use NAT networking, browser performance was slow the first time you launched Internet Explorer 7 or 8 after starting the virtual machine for the first time and after resuming the virtual machine. Now, browser performance has been improved.

Known Issues with VMware Fusion

The known issues for VMware Fusion are grouped by topic in the following sections.

Virtual Machine Creation Issues
User Interface Issues
Guest Operating System Issues
File and Application Sharing Issues
Application Issues
Virtual Machine Import Issues
PC Migration Issues
Device Issues
Miscellaneous Issues
Virtual Machine Creation Issues

If you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.
If you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.

The default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and AutoProtect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.

Workaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.

Delete all snapshots for the virtual machine:
Select Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.
(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.
Click the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.
Click Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.
Rebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:
Power off the virtual machine.
Click the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.
Under Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.
Deselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.
VMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.
You might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.
After you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.
Unable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. 
Installation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.

Workaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.
A virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.
VMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.
Installation can stall with the message, Please insert the "<username>" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.
If you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.

Workarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:
Install from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).
Install using a different user account that does not use FileVault.
Easy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.
When you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.
You must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.
For VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.
VMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines
Installation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\.psf\Home\Documents.

Workaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.
Cannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. 
Having a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.
Before installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. 
If you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.

You can remove those packages by running the following command as root

$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default

Or you can use the Software Management application in YaST:
Open YaST.
Click on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).
Find and click Software Management.
Remove the packages.
User Interface Issues

Unity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.
When a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.
In some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.
This can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.

Workaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.
On MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.
In this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, "A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers."

To work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.
Power off the virtual machine.
Select Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.
Select Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.
With Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.
If you use command+d or control+option+d ("show desktop") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.

Workaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.
Cannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.
This problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.
When you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.
Aero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.
Virtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.
When you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.
While running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.
This occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.
Putting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.
The default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. 

Workaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.
Keyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.
If you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.
Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.
The size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.
Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.
Because of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.
QuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.
Occasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.
Disable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Having a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.
3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: "DirectX error message . . ."
If the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.
Editing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.
VMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.
Guest Operating System Issues

Do not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.
Using fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.
The universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. 
These physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.

Workaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine and use a combo updater to update directly to 10.6.4 or 10.6.5 (the latest version at time of writing).
Install GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. 
VMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, "Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error".
On SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.
Workaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.
From the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.
To turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.
If you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.
If you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.
Some dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.

To delete old dockers, take the following steps.
Suspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.
Open the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.
Close the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.
New dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.
In certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.
Occasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.
In some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.
If you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:
svga.vramSize = "33554432"
Save the file.
Power up the virtual machine again.
Cannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors 
The installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. 
Workaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:
monitor.virtual_exec="hardware"
monitor.virtual_mmu="software"
Save the file.
Power up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.
Install Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.
Install Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.
File and Application Sharing Issues

Do not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.
If you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.

Workaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.
If you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.
In a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.
Shared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.
You can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.

Workaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.
VMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.
If you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.
Old .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.
With VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\.host\Shared Folders to \\vmware-host\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.
Default applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.
Setting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.
If a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.
If you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.
Sometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. 
There are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating "file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest." VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.
Working offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.
Using mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.

Workaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.
The Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.
In some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.
Default browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.
In certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.
Application Issues

Audio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.
Playback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.
Some 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.
Running certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.

Workaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.
3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.
If you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.
Select Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.
Deselect 3D.
Internet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. 
If you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, "Protected Mode" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.

Workaround:

Open Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.
Click the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).
Click Sites, then Advanced, type \\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.
Back in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.
Click OK, and accept the warning, "The current security settings will put your computer at risk," by clicking OK again.
Close Internet Explorer to apply the change.
Internet Explorer will now open files from \\vmware-host correctly.

Some games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.
Parts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.
After quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.
Galactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.
This problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.
Running certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.
Games known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.
Running the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.
On a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.
Virtual Machine Import Issues

VMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.
When you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.
VMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.
While importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).

Workaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:
Select Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.
Select Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.
Select the Show advanced settings check box.
Select 0:0 in the Location box.
Registry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system 
After importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.
Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.
VMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.
If you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. 

To work around this problem
Quit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp
Delete Boot Camp
Restart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition
Flat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.
VMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.
Reconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.
Some virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, "The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time." If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.
Using the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.
If this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.
Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)
PC Migration Issues

VMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.
If you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:
Insufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)

Workaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.

If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.
If the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.
Because of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.
Do not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.
For instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, "Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine."
Sound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.
If you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.

Workaround: Add a sound device.
Power off the virtual machine.
Choose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.
In the Removable Devices section, select Sound.
Click Add Sound Device and close the window.
Power on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.
Device Issues

NEW An error occurs when you connect a Globetrotter Connect iCON 225 USB device to the host.
Workaround: Update the host operating system to Mac OS 10.6.6.
If you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.
Connecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.
On Mac OS X 10.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.
Upgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 or later fixes this issue.
If you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.
If you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, "The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size." However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.

Workaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.
If you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.
Having iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, "iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: "The iPad "name" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602)."

If you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.
Attempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.
Mounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.

Workaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.
DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.
Buggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.
On Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.
Enabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.
Selecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.
You cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.
If you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.
VMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.
VMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.

To add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.

If you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.
Miscellaneous Issues

OVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.
If OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.

Workaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: "$OVFTOOL_BIN" "$@"

Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issues:

The error Could not publish or run one or more applications. occurs when resuming a virtual machine that has DivX Player installed in the guest.
Slingbox Slingplayer does not display video in the guest when 3D acceleration is enabled. In addition, very high CPU usage occurs if the guest is set to 1 core.
Microsoft Office applications do not display as the frontmost window when they are launched in Unity view.
Sound volume in the guest operating system is reduced after upgrading to Fusion 3.1. The volume observed through the host is not consistent with the guest volume setting.
In a Windows XP guest, if you connect a handheld device to the host, the handshake application might time out or stop responding due to unhandled USB disable requests.
While the virtual machine is running, if you switch from full screen mode to single window mode, the virtual machine window disappears and the light underneath the Fusion icon disappears as well. Fusion stops responding if you restart after this issue occurs.
The guest operating system might fail with a blue screen and the error Multiple IRP Complete Requests if you access a file or folder two or more folders deep into a VMware Shared Folder and are running applications, such as Microsoft Office Powerpoint or Project, that use the byte range locks file system feature.
Samsung Galaxy S phone with Android 2.1 does not work with Fusion. The phone does not appear in the virtual machine.
Guest software might use CPUID information to determine characteristics of underlying (virtual or physical) CPU hardware. In some instances, CPUID information returned by virtual hardware will differ from the responses physical hardware might report. Based on these differences, certain pieces of guest software might not behave as expected. In this release, this fix causes certain CPUID responses to more closely match the responses that physical hardware might return.
If you run Outlook 2007 in Unity mode, the Outlook dock icon might flash, or briefly quit and restart. When this happens the Outlook window also disappears and then reappears.
Mac OS X Server guests might intermittently fail to boot, displaying a stop symbol on a gray screen shortly after powering on.
Additionally, this release resolves the following security-related issues:

The way temporary files are handled by the mounting process could result in a race condition. This issue could allow a local user on the host to elevate their privileges. Windows-based host systems are not affected.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4295 to this issue.
vmware-mount, which is a SUID binary, has a flaw in the way libraries are loaded. This issue could allow local users on the host to execute arbitrary shared object files with root privileges. Windows-based host systems are not affected.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4296 to this issue.
A vulnerability in the input validation of VMware Tools update allows for injection of commands. This issue could allow a user on the host to execute commands on the guest operating system with root privileges. The issue can only be exploited if VMware Tools is not fully up-to-date. Windows-based virtual machines are not affected. 

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-4297 to this issue.

Virtual Machine Creation Issues

If you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.
If you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.

The default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and AutoProtect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.

Workaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.

Delete all snapshots for the virtual machine:
Select Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.
(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.
Click the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.
Click Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.
Rebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:
Power off the virtual machine.
Click the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.
Under Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.
Deselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.
VMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.
You might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.
After you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.
Unable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. 
Installation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.

Workaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.
A virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.
VMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.
Installation can stall with the message, Please insert the "<username>" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.
If you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.

Workarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:
Install from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).
Install using a different user account that does not use FileVault.
Easy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.
When you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.
You must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.
For VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.
VMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines
Installation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\.psf\Home\Documents.

Workaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.
Cannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. 
Having a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.
Before installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. 
If you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.

You can remove those packages by running the following command as root

$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default

Or you can use the Software Management application in YaST:
Open YaST.
Click on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).
Find and click Software Management.
Remove the packages.
User Interface Issues

Unity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.
When a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.
In some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.
This can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.

Workaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.
On MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.
In this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, "A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers."

To work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.
Power off the virtual machine.
Select Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.
Select Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.
With Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.
If you use command+d or control+option+d ("show desktop") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.

Workaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.
Cannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.
This problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.
When you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.
Aero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.
Virtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.
When you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.
While running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.
This occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.
Putting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.
The default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. 

Workaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.
Keyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.
If you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.
Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.
The size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.
Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.
Because of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.
QuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.
Occasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.
Disable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Having a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.
3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: "DirectX error message . . ."
If the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.
Editing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.
VMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.
Guest Operating System Issues

Do not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.
Using fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.
The universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. 
These physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.

Workaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine and use a combo updater to update directly to 10.6.4 or 10.6.5 (the latest version at time of writing).
Install GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. 
VMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, "Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error".
On SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.
Workaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.
From the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.
To turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.
If you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.
If you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.
Some dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.

To delete old dockers, take the following steps.
Suspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.
Open the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.
Close the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.
New dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.
In certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.
Occasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.
In some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.
If you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:
svga.vramSize = "33554432"
Save the file.
Power up the virtual machine again.
Cannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors 
The installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. 
Workaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:
monitor.virtual_exec="hardware"
monitor.virtual_mmu="software"
Save the file.
Power up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.
Install Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.
Install Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.
File and Application Sharing Issues

Do not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.
If you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.

Workaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.
If you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.
In a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.
Shared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.
You can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.

Workaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.
VMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.
If you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.
Old .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.
With VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\.host\Shared Folders to \\vmware-host\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.
Default applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.
Setting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.
If a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.
If you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.
Sometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. 
There are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating "file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest." VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.
Working offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.
Using mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.

Workaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.
The Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.
In some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.
Default browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.
In certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.
Application Issues

Audio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.
Playback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.
Some 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.
Running certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.

Workaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.
3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.
If you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.
Select Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.
Deselect 3D.
Internet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. 
If you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, "Protected Mode" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.

Workaround:

Open Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.
Click the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).
Click Sites, then Advanced, type \\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.
Back in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.
Click OK, and accept the warning, "The current security settings will put your computer at risk," by clicking OK again.
Close Internet Explorer to apply the change.
Internet Explorer will now open files from \\vmware-host correctly.

Some games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.
Parts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.
After quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.
Galactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.
This problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.
Running certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.
Games known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.
Running the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.
On a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.
Virtual Machine Import Issues

VMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.
When you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.
VMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.
While importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).

Workaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:
Select Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.
Select Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.
Select the Show advanced settings check box.
Select 0:0 in the Location box.
Registry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system 
After importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.
Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.
VMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.
If you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. 

To work around this problem
Quit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp
Delete Boot Camp
Restart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition
Flat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.
VMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.
Reconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.
Some virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, "The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time." If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.
Using the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.
If this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.
Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)
PC Migration Issues

VMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.
If you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:
Insufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)

Workaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.

If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.
If the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.
Because of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.
Do not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.
For instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, "Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine."
Sound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.
If you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.

Workaround: Add a sound device.
Power off the virtual machine.
Choose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.
In the Removable Devices section, select Sound.
Click Add Sound Device and close the window.
Power on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.
Device Issues

If you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.
Connecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.
On Mac OS X 10.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.
Upgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 or later fixes this issue.
If you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.
If you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, "The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size." However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.

Workaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.
If you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.
Having iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, "iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: "The iPad "name" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602)."

If you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.
Attempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.
Mounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.

Workaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.
DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.
Buggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.
On Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.
Enabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.
Selecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.
You cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.
If you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.
VMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.
VMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.

To add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.

If you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.
Miscellaneous Issues

OVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.
If OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.

Workaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: "$OVFTOOL_BIN" "$@"

What's New

VMware Fusion 3.1.1 is a maintenance release that resolves the following issues and adds new support. It is a free upgrade for all VMware Fusion 3.x users.

VMware vSphere 4.1 is now supported as a guest operating system. VMware Certified Professionals (VCPs) and virtualization experts can use VMware vSphere 4.1 to install the latest server virtualization software and experiment with server setup, conduct training, show demos, and test production configurations. Running ESX as a guest eliminates the need to have spare hardware available to run ESX natively and enables ESX to run on systems that are not listed on the ESX hardware compatibility list (HCL). For more information on the supported processors and host operating systems, see see Considerations for Running an ESX Guest.
This feature is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production environments. To use this feature, you must download vSphere 4.1 from the VMware Web site and follow the installation documentation provided with VMware vSphere to install ESX.

For more information on VMware vSphere, see http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/.

Resolves an issue around accessing some iSight cameras.
Resolves an issue where an incorrect disk error message appeared after a host crash occurs while working in a virtual machine.
Resolves an issue where audio recording failed when the recording device output was not 44.1 kHz.

Virtual Machine Creation Issues

If you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.
If you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.

The default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and autoprotect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.

Workaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.

Delete all snapshots for the virtual machine:
Select Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.
(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.
Click the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.
Click Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.
Rebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:
Power off the virtual machine.
Click the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.
Under Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.
Deselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.
VMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.
You might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.
After you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.
Unable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. 
Installation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.

Workaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.
A virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.
VMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.
Installation can stall with the message, Please insert the "<username>" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.
If you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.

Workarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:
Install from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).
Install using a different user account that does not use FileVault.
Easy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.
When you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.
You must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.
For VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.
VMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines
Installation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\.psf\Home\Documents.

Workaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.
Cannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. 
Having a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.
Before installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. 
If you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.

You can remove those packages by running the following command as root

$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default

Or you can use the Software Management application in YaST:
Open YaST.
Click on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).
Find and click Software Management.
Remove the packages.
User Interface Issues

Unity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.
When a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.
In some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.
This can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.

Workaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.
On MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.
In this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, "A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers."

To work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.
Power off the virtual machine.
Select Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.
Select Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.
With Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.
If you use command+d or control+option+d ("show desktop") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.

Workaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.
Cannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.
This problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.
When you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.
Aero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.
Virtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.
When you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.
While running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.
This occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.
Putting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.
The default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. 

Workaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.
Keyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.
If you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.
Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.
The size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.
Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.
Because of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.
QuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.
Occasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.
Disable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Having a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.
3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: "DirectX error message . . ."
If the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.
Editing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.
VMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.
Guest Operating System Issues

Do not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.
Using fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.
The universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. 
These physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.

Workaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine, and do not update the guest operating system until Apple releases 10.6.4.
Install GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. 
VMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, "Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error".
On SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.
Workaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.
From the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.
To turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.
If you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.
If you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.
Some dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.

To delete old dockers, take the following steps.
Suspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.
Open the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.
Close the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.
New dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.
In certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.
Occasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.
In some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.
If you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:
svga.vramSize = "33554432"
Save the file.
Power up the virtual machine again.
Cannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors 
The installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. 
Workaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:
monitor.virtual_exec="hardware"
monitor.virtual_mmu="software"
Save the file.
Power up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.
Install Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.
Install Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.
File and Application Sharing Issues

Do not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.
If you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.

Workaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.
If you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.
In a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.
Shared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.
You can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.

Workaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.
VMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.
If you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.
Old .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.
With VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\.host\Shared Folders to \\vmware-host\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.
Default applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.
Setting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.
If a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.
If you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.
Sometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. 
There are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating "file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest." VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.
Working offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.
Using mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.

Workaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.
The Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.
In some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.
Default browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.
In certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.
Application Issues

Audio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.
Playback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.
Some 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.
Running certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.

Workaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.
3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.
If you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.
Select Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.
Deselect 3D.
Internet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. 
If you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, "Protected Mode" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.

Workaround:

Open Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.
Click the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).
Click Sites, then Advanced, type \\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.
Back in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.
Click OK, and accept the warning, "The current security settings will put your computer at risk," by clicking OK again.
Close Internet Explorer to apply the change.
Internet Explorer will now open files from \\vmware-host correctly.

Some games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.
Parts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.
After quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.
Galactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.
This problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.
Running certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.
Games known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.
Running the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.
On a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.
Virtual Machine Import Issues

VMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.
When you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.
VMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.
While importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).

Workaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:
Select Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.
Select Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.
Select the Show advanced settings check box.
Select 0:0 in the Location box.
Registry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system 
After importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.
Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.
VMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.
If you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. 

To work around this problem
Quit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp
Delete Boot Camp
Restart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition
Flat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.
VMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.
Reconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.
Some virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, "The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time." If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.
Using the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.
If this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.
Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)
PC Migration Issues

VMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.
If you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:
Insufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)

Workaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.

If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.
If the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.
Because of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.
Do not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.
For instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, "Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine."
Sound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.
If you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.

Workaround: Add a sound device.
Power off the virtual machine.
Choose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.
In the Removable Devices section, select Sound.
Click Add Sound Device and close the window.
Power on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.
Device Issues

If you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.
Connecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.
On Mac OS X 10.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.
Upgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 fixes this issue.
If you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.
If you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, "The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size." However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.

Workaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.
If you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.
Having iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, "iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: "The iPad "name" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602)."

If you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.
Attempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.
Mounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.

Workaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.
DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.
Buggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.
On Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.
Enabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.
Selecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.
You cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.
If you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.
VMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.
VMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.

To add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.

If you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.
Miscellaneous Issues

OVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.
If OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.

Workaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: "$OVFTOOL_BIN" "$@"

Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issues:

Some iSight video cameras fail to connect to Windows virtual machines. These devices automatically switch device IDs and reset when they detect that they have been moved from Mac OS to a Windows OS, and the reset initiates the USB EasyConnect service which results in the device being connected back to the Mac host.
Mounting a .vmdk on Mac OS X using VMDKMounter might occasionally display the error message VMDKmounter cannot open files in the VMware virtual disk format. This error message displays if the VMDKMounter is prevented from writing its log file. This update release resolves the permissions issue and enables the VMDK files to mount successfully.
When a host system failure occurs during a virtual machine disk operation, attempting to power on the virtual machine or mount the virtual disk using the VMware Disk Mount utility causes the following error messages to appear, "Cannot open the disk... The specified virtual disk needs repair" and "Error reading volume information. Please select another disk file". There is no data lost during this process. VMware Fusion 3.1.1 fixes these issues and enables virtual machine operations to resume.
Audio recordings can now be made from devices that output at a sampling rate other than the default rate expected by the host. Typically, the default sampling rate is 44.1 KHz. Audio recordings that are out of sync occasionally play back at a faster rate than expected or would fail to play. This update release matches the sampling rate used by the recording software to the output rate of the physical device and resolves this issue.

Top of Page

Before You Begin

Use the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system.
Important: VMware Fusion requires Mac OS X 10.5.8 ("Leopard") or later. It will not install on Mac OS X 10.4 ("Tiger").

Installing VMware Fusion 3.1 will overwrite earlier versions of the application.
It is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time, so if you install VMware Fusion 3.1 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 3.0.x, 2.x or 1.x, the VMware Fusion 3.1 version replaces the earlier version. This change does not affect your virtual machines. 
If you want to revert to version 3.0.x, 2.x or 1.x, you will need to reinstall it.

Installation Notes

VMware Tools
In order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion "light" installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.

If you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-version-build.dmg).

McAfee VirusScan for Mac
If you have installed McAfee VirusScan for Mac, exclude your virtual machines from any scan to avoid potential corruption of your virtual hard disks.
To prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.

On your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.
Click Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.
Click More Options.
Select Click lock to make changes.
Select Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.
Select the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.
Lock your changes and close the window.
The virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.

PC Migration Notes

For some best practices and troubleshooting information, see "Migration Assistant: A Guide" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.

VMware Fusion Migrate Your PC
The Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 7. You can migrate a PC to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 Leopard and Mac OS X 10.6.3 Snow Leopard.

The VMware Fusion Migration Agent installer must be downloaded from the VMware web site and installed on the source PC. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac.
md5 checksum (VMware-FusionPCMigrationAgent-4.0.7-261056.exe) = deb27dc2b92a63eac7e70f7cd9b3bbd7

Before migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.
In the Control Panel, click Power Options.
On the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.
Before migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.
The Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.

If you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.
The simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.

Right-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.
Select the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.
You must not run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.
If you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you must not run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.
Workaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.

Migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.
After migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.
Start the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.
Download a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).
Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.
Tools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.

Manual Tools Reinstall for Migrated Windows Vista and Windows 7
The automatic installation of VMware Tools in a migrated virtual machine must be followed by a manual install of Tools for virtual machines with Windows Vista and Windows 7.

Start the virtual machine. VMware Fusion installs VMware Tools.
Restart the virtual machine when the automatic tools installation is completed.
In the VMware Fusion menu, select Virtual Machine > Upgrade VMware Tools to initiate a manual installation.
Select Repair in the Installer that runs in the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine.
Restart the virtual machine at the end of the manual tools installation.

Virtual Machine Creation Issues

If you split a large virtual disk into 2GB files, or if you have too many snapshots, you can exceed the open file limit of the Mac OS and cause the virtual machine to fail, and potentially damage the virtual hard disk.
If you have a large virtual hard disk, or if you intend to use a lot of snapshots, you should not split a virtual machine's virtual hard disk into 2GB files. For smaller virtual hard disks, you can limit the number of snapshots you take.

The default limit for open files on the Mac is 256. If you have a large virtual disk split into 2GB files, for instance a 500GB virtual disk split into 250 files, taking a snapshot immediately exceeds the limit because the snapshot attempts to create another 250 files. This can cause the virtual machine to fail when powered on, or fail when taking a snapshot. If you have smaller virtual hard disks, but are taking many manual snapshots and autoprotect snapshots, the limit can be exceeded as well.

Workaround: If you have encountered this problem, you can attempt to recover by converting the split files into a monolithic file. Converting to a monolithic virtual hard disk is a two-stage process.

Delete all snapshots for the virtual machine:
Select Virtual Machine > Snapshots > Snapshots.
(Optional) If Only show my snapshots is selected, deselect it.
Click the snapshot to delete, or shift-click to select multiple snapshots, and select Delete Snapshot.
Click Delete to discard the snapshot and merge its changes into the parent virtual disk.
Rebuild the virtual hard disk files as a monolithic file:
Power off the virtual machine.
Click the virtual machine thumbnail in the Virtual Machine Library and click Settings.
Under Removable Devices in the Settings window, select Hard Disks.
Deselect Split disk into 2GB files, and click Apply.
VMware Fusion displays a progress dialog as it rebuilds the virtual disk.

You might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.
After you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.

Unable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine. 
Installation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.

Workaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.

A virtual machine powered on from the Boot Camp partition can fail if the Boot Camp partition uses a display connected as a USB device.
VMware Fusion does not support USB adapters for connecting displays to virtual machines, such as a DisplayLink USB adapter. Windows 7 running natively in a Boot Camp partition can support displays connected as a USB device. If you power on such a partition as a virtual machine, the Windows 7 guest operating system fails because of the USB device present. At this time, the only way to be able to power on the Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine is to remove the USB display device driver from Boot Camp when you have booted into it natively. After this, you can power on the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine, but neither the virtual machine nor the native Boot Camp partition will use the USB display.

Installation can stall with the message, Please insert the "<username>" disc to continue installation if the installer is in a FileVault volume.
If you have downloaded the VMware Fusion installer to a FileVault volume on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5, a bug in the Apple installer can cause it to look for a non-existent disc. This does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.

Workarounds for Mac OS X 10.5:
Install from a location outside the FileVault volume (put the installer outside the FileVault home directory, or into its own disk image).
Install using a different user account that does not use FileVault.

Easy Install of CentOS 4 can require user input at the beginning of the installation.
When you create a virtual machine using a CentOS 4 DVD or CD image, the New Virtual Machine Assistant might offer to use Easy Install to create the virtual machine. Usually, Easy Install provides an unattended install experience, but in this particular case, the installation process asks a few questions at the very beginning of the install. Answer those and the installation will be unattended from there.

You must update VMware Tools manually when you upgrade VMware Fusion from version 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3.
For VMware Tools, automatic updates or updates from within a virtual machine do not work if you are upgrading from VMware Fusion 2.0.x to VMware Fusion 3. This means that you cannot update VMware Tools from the guest by clicking Update Tools in the VMware Tools Properties dialog. To do a manual update, select Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menu bar.

VMware Tools installation fails in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines
Installation of VMware Tools might fail in German and French language Parallels 4 virtual machines that have file sharing enabled. VMware Tools might display the error message Error 1606. Could not access network location \\.psf\Home\Documents.

Workaround: Uninstall Parallels 4 Tools and then install VMware Tools.

Cannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected. 
Having a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.

Before installing VMware Tools on an openSUSE 11.x guest, you must uninstall a number of rpms from the guest. 
If you want to install VMware Tools onto a guest running openSUSE 11.x, you must first uninstall the open-vmware-tools, open-vmware-tools-gui, and vmware-kmp-default rpms before you can successfully install VMware Tools.

You can remove those packages by running the following command as root

$ rpm -e open-vmware-tools open-vmware-tools-gui vmware-kmp-default

Or you can use the Software Management application in YaST:
Open YaST.
Click on the Software button located on the left side of the YaST window (optional, but helpful).
Find and click Software Management.
Remove the packages.

User Interface Issues

Unity view windows can disappear, then reappear, if a guest application becomes unresponsive for a period of time.
When a guest application becomes unresponsive for a while (for instance, when Outlook is in the process of sending an email), if that application is open in Unity view, its window can disappear during that period of unresponsiveness.

In some instances a Unity view window brought forward does not show contents previously obscured by a Mac application window.
This can occur with Mac OS X 10.6 running on your Mac.

Workaround: Move the window to refresh the contents.

On MacBooks with the Intel GMA X3100 graphics card, using Exposé in Unity view can cause VMware Fusion to fail if 3D acceleration is turned off.
In this instance, VMware Fusion can fail with the alert, "A serious error has occurred inside your computer's OpenGL graphics drivers."

To work around this problem, enable 3D acceleration.
Power off the virtual machine.
Select Virtual Machine > Settings, and click Display.
Select Accelerate 3D Graphics, close the window, and restart the virtual machine.

With Ubuntu 10.04, and with Windows XP in certain cases, do not use a keyboard shortcut to minimize all windows when you are using Unity view.
If you use command+d or control+option+d ("show desktop") to minimize an application window when you are using Unity view, the window can get into a loop of minimizing and restoring. This can occur with Ubuntu 10.04 on a Mac running 10.5.8 and 10.6.3, and with Windows XP on a Mac running 10.5.8 only.

Workaround: Switch to Single Window view, then return to Unity view. Use command+m to minimize each window separately.

Cannot run OpenGL applications using full screen view across multiple displays with a Windows XP virtual machine.
This problem does not occur with Windows 7 virtual machines.

When you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.
Aero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.

Virtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.
When you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.

While running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.
This occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.

Putting a Mac OS X Server guest to sleep causes the virtual machine to become unresponsive.
The default setting for Mac OS X Server is for it to never sleep. However, if you change the setting or use Apple > Sleep, the virtual machine becomes unresponsive. 

Workaround: Shut down the virtual machine and restart it, and make sure System Preferences is set to prevent sleeping: In the Energy Saver window, set the Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for: slider to Never. Do not use Apple > Sleep.

Keyboard input works improperly in one virtual machine if another virtual machine is being suspended at the time of the keyboard input.
If you suspend a virtual machine, and start some keyboard operation in another open virtual machine before the suspending is complete, the key input acts erratically. This issue disappears when the suspending process completes. Workaround: Wait until a virtual machine is completely suspended before using the keyboard in another open virtual machine.

Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for images is limited by the size of the internal buffer.
The size limitation for image copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop is the internal buffer size, not the actual image file size. As a result, you might not be able to move an image file that is smaller than the limit of 4MB because the internal buffer exceeds that limit.

Copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop for formatted text containing images does not work in a number of cases.
Because of different protocols, copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop of formatted text containing images or other non-text elements can result in only the formatted text being moved, without the elements.

QuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view.
Occasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen or jumbled graphics.

Disable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Having a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.

3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: "DirectX error message . . ."
If the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.

Editing the default suspend script in VMware Tools can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state the next time you attempt to suspend it.
VMware recommends that you do not edit the default suspend script suspend-vm-default.bat. An incorrect script can cause the virtual machine to become stuck in the suspend state. If you are not able to edit the default script back to its original content, you can restore it by uninstalling and reinstalling VMware Tools.

Guest Operating System Issues

Do not use fast user switching with Windows virtual machines.
Using fast user switching can result in unpredictable behavior in the virtual machine, including problems with the mouse and with CPU usage.

The universal Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) operating system does not work inside a virtual machine on the physical MacBook Pro models with Core i7 processors, released in April 2010. 
These physical machines were released after Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) was released, and they have a processor that Mac OS X Server 10.6.3 (build 10d573) does not support. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 and http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11430561 for details.

Workaround: Install Mac OS X Server 10.6 in the virtual machine, and do not update the guest operating system until Apple releases 10.6.4.

Install GCC in order to install VMware Tools and to share folders in openSUSE 11.3. 
VMware Fusion 3.1 does not include prebuilt kernel modules for openSUSE 11.3. If you want to use openSUSE 11.3, you must install the gcc compiler prior to installation of VMware Tools, so that the kernel modules can be compiled during Tools installation. Without the compiler installed, trying to enable shared folders produces the alert, "Unable to update run-time folder sharing status: Unknown error".

On SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.0 and 11.1 guests with PulseAudio version earlier than 0.9.19, the timer based scheduling with PulseAudio might not work properly with the virtual sound card ENS1371.
Workaround: Turn off the timer-based scheduling and use the interrupt-based approach.
From the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop guest, open the /etc/pulse/default.pa file.
To turn off the timer-based scheduling, change the load-module module-udev-detect code to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0.
If you do not find the load-module module-udev-detect code in the file, then change the load-module module-hal-detect code to load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0.

If you have been using Ubuntu 10.04 with a VMware Fusion build earlier than this build or the release candidate build, you must delete some existing dockers to get certain dock icons to work in Unity view.
Some dock icons for applications in your Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine that you created prior to downloading this build of VMware Fusion will not work after you upgrade. You must delete the existing docker files for those applications after upgrading to VMware Fusion 3.1. After you delete the files, VMware Fusion produces new dockers that work properly.

To delete old dockers, take the following steps.
Suspend or shut down the virtual machine and quit VMware Fusion.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the Ubuntu virtual machine is located. The default is user/Documents/Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 10.04 virtual machine and select Show Package Contents.
Open the Applications folder in the package, and delete the contents.
Close the package, start VMware Fusion, and resume the virtual machine.
New dockers are created automatically the first time you run the applications in Unity view.

In certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.
Occasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.

In some cases, the virtual machine window can become black if you disable 3D acceleration.
If you have high resolution set in your Windows Vista or Windows 7 guest operating system (1600x1200 and above), the virtual machine window can become black if you turn off 3D. To work around this problem, set your virtual machine's VRAM to at least 32MB when 3D is turned off. You set the VRAM in the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx).
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Vista or Windows 7 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following line to the file:
svga.vramSize = "33554432"
Save the file.
Power up the virtual machine again.

Cannot install Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on Mac Pros with Quad-core Nehalem processors 
The installation of the Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit guest operating system on a Mac Pro with Quad-core Nehalem processors will fail with a message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. 
Workaround: add two lines to the VMX configuration file of the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine by using the following steps.
Navigate to the Mac folder where the virtual machine is located. The default is your Home folder > Documents > Virtual Machines.
Right click on the Ubuntu 8.10 virtual machine package and select Show Package Contents.
In a text editor open the file named <virtual machine name>.vmx, and add the following lines to the file:
monitor.virtual_exec="hardware"
monitor.virtual_mmu="software"
Save the file.
Power up the Ubuntu virtual machine again.

Install Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.

Install Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.

File and Application Sharing Issues

Do not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.
If you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.

Workaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.

If you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.
In a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.

Shared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.
You can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.

Workaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.

VMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.
If you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.

Old .host alias for Shared Folders might still appear under My Network Places in Windows after upgrade to a version of VMware Fusion 3.
With VMware Fusion 3, the UNC name path for Shared Folders was changed from \\.host\Shared Folders to \\vmware-host\Shared Folders. If you used shared folders in a previous release, you might still see the .host alias in My Network Places after upgrading to a version of VMware Fusion 3. If you select Shared Folders on .host and try to use it, you get a message that it cannot be found. Workaround: Delete the alias by right clicking on it and selecting delete.

Default applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.
Setting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.

If a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.
If you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.

Sometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application. 
There are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating "file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest." VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.

Working offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.
Using mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.

Workaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.

The Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server.
In some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.

Default browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.
In certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.

Application Issues

Audio recording is broken in Windows virtual machines with Adobe Audition.
Playback after recording produces unusable sounds and static. There is no workaround.

Some 3D applications in a virtual machine can cause a Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to become unresponsive.
Running certain video games and other 3D applications in VMware Fusion on Macs with Mac OS X 10.5 and the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets can cause the Mac to become unresponsive.

Workaround: Apple has fixed the underlying problem in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. If you have a Mac with NVIDIA hardware, upgrade to Snow Leopard to use 3D applications in a virtual machine.

3D in Topo USA 8.0 can cause VMware Fusion to fail with an unrecoverable error message.
If you encounter problems switching to 3D using Topo USA 8.0 GPS software, disable 3D in the application by using the Start menu from the guest operating system.
Select Start > Programs > DeLorme > Topo USA 8.0 > Tools > Tab Manager.
Deselect 3D.

Internet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host. 
If you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, "Protected Mode" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\vmware-host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.

Workaround:
Open Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.
Click the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).
Click Sites, then Advanced, type \\vmware-host and click Add, then Close and OK.
Back in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.
Click OK, and accept the warning, "The current security settings will put your computer at risk," by clicking OK again.
Close Internet Explorer to apply the change.

Internet Explorer will now open files from \\vmware-host correctly.

Some games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.
Parts of the application window for Google SketchUp remain on the desktop after you quit the application.
After quitting Google SketchUp, the SketchUp toolbar remains on the desktop, and the guest cursor remains the one for whatever tool Sketchup was using last. Workaround: Enable hardware acceleration within SketchUp. From the SketchUp menu bar, select Window > Preferences > OpenGL, and select Use hardware acceleration.

Galactic Civilizations II fails or becomes unresponsive when it starts to load.
This problem can occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.5.8, but does not appear on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Solution: Upgrade to Snow Leopard.

Running certain 3D games and applications with ATI X1900 can cause your Mac to become unresponsive.
Games known to cause issues with the ATI X1900 include Shin Megami Tensei and Portal. This occurs both with Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.

Running the 3DMark2001 SE Dragothic test can cause the virtual machine to freeze if certain conditions exist.
On a Mac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 and running Mac OS X 10.5.8, a virtual machine might freeze with an error message if you have run the Dragothic test in conjunction with another test. Running Dragothic by itself does not have this issue.

Virtual Machine Import Issues

VMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine.
When you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.

VMware Fusion UI fails while importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine.
While importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine or Parallels server virtual machine, the VMware Fusion UI might close with an error The application vmware quit unexpectedly, if the Parallels virtual machine’s system disk is not labeled 0:0 (the default value).

Workaround: Set the Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine’s system disk value as 0:0 (default) as follows:
Select Configure from the Virtual Machine menu.
Select Hard Disk in the left navigation bar.
Select the Show advanced settings check box.
Select 0:0 in the Location box.

Registry corruption message after importing Parallels Desktop 4 with Windows 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system 
After importing a Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machine with the Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP 64-bit operating system, you might see the following message upon the first login: Registry hive (file:SYSTEM) has been corrupted and has been recovered. Some data may have been lost. In reality, this message is not a result of registry corruption, and no data has been lost. The message can be ignored, and does not occur on subsequent logins.

Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2 or later.
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.

VMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.
If you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. 

To work around this problem
Quit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp
Delete Boot Camp
Restart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition

Flat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.
VMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.

Reconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.
Some virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, "The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time." If you get this alert, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.

Using the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.
If this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.

Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)

PC Migration Issues

VMware Fusion does not support using the Migration Assistant on a PC with a recovery partition.
If you start a migration of a PC with a recovery partition, the migration fails with the error:
Insufficient space on the source to store VSS snapshots or the source does not have any NTFS volumes. Error code:2147754783(0x8004231F)

Workaround: If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows XP or Windows Vista with a recovery partition, you can use the vCenter Standalone Converter http://www.vmware.com/download/converter.

If you are attempting to convert a physical machine with Windows 7 with a recovery partition, there is currently no workaround.

If the network link is broken during PC migration, the process does not fail and might not produce an error message.
Because of a timeout issue, a lost network link might not cause the migration process to fail with an alert. In these instances, the migration process can appear as if it is continuing to do work even though the lack of a network link prevents migration. There is no workaround.

Do not install the VMware Fusion Migration Agent on the source physical machine using non-ASCII characters in the path.
For instance, do not install with a kanji character, or an umlaut, or other non-ASCII character. Doing so results in VMware Fusion not able to reconfigure the new virtual machine after the migration process finishes copying it. VMware Fusion displays the alert, "Unable to reconfigure the target virtual machine."

Sound might not work in certain virtual machines migrated from physical PCs.
If you use the Migrate Your PC feature to create a virtual machine from a physical PC running some Windows Vista or Windows XP Professional operating systems, sound might not work because of the lack of a sound device.

Workaround: Add a sound device.
Power off the virtual machine.
Choose Virtual Machine > Settings to open the Settings window.
In the Removable Devices section, select Sound.
Click Add Sound Device and close the window.
Power on the virtual machine and reinstall VMware Tools.

Device Issues

If you are running Mac OS X 10.5.8, VMware Fusion does not recognize a virtual smart card.
Connecting a smart card to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 does not result in VMware Fusion recognizing it. This issue does not occur on Macs running Mac OS X 10.6.2.

On Mac OS X 1.6.2, a smart card might not work in a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine due to a card sharing violation error.
Upgrading the host to Mac OS X 10.6.3 fixes this issue.

If you try to add a new virtual hard disk when there is not enough free space on your Mac, you cannot resize that virtual hard disk to a smaller size.
If you do not have enough free space for a new virtual disk of the size you have set, a message appears when you click Apply in the Hard Disk Settings panel, "The current amount of free space on the hard disk is not enough to create the specified disk file. Please choose a different location or specify a smaller disk size." However, when you try to make the disk smaller you can't, because the scroll box for disk size cannot be moved to the left to indicate a smaller size.

Workaround: Delete this newly created disk, which is empty. Create a new, smaller disk.

If you have iTunes running on your Mac and iTunes running in a virtual machine when you connect an iPad, an iPad restore can fail under certain conditions.
Having iTunes running on your Mac and in a virtual machine at the same time, you might encounter a problem when you connect an iPad to the virtual machine using the VMware Fusion USB connection dialog, and start a restore. This can produce the alert, "iTunes has detected an iPad in recovery mode. You must restore this iPad before it can be used with iTunes". If you click OK the iPad is recognized by iTunes on the Mac, but iTunes in the virtual machine is waiting for it to reconnect. The iPad doesn't reconnect, however, because it is connected to the host iTunes, and the virtual machine presents an alert: "The iPad "name" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1602)."

If you encounter this issue, you can connect the iPad to the iTunes virtual machine by using the Virtual Machine menu, and carry on the restore. Select Virtual Machine > USB, and select Connect Apple iPad.

Attempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8.
Mounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.

Workaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.

DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD.
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion. Other players, like PowerDVD, are designed not to run in a virtual machine. Workaround: Use VLC Player.

Buggy PCSC framework (Apple problem ID 7151374) can cause VMware Fusion to fail when powering on a virtual machine.
On Mac OS X, PCSC framework is installed by default. Because of a PC/SC Lite bug, VMware Fusion can fail during a virtual machine power-on. VMware Fusion partially works around this bug by deleting a redundant pcscd.pub file on the system. However, if you have installed libpcsc-lite in a custom directory, VMware Fusion can't detect this file and you must delete the file manually using root privileges.

Enabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.
Selecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.

You cannot mount a virtual disk on a virtual machine in a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard host with 64-bit kernel.
If you try to use VMDKMounter on a 64-bit kernel Mac OS X 10.6 host, you get an alert stating The VMware fuse daemon failed to start. Currently, MacFUSE does not work with 64-bit kernels.

VMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.
VMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.

To add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.

If you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.

Miscellaneous Issues

OVF Tool 2.0.0 might not open correctly, depending on the path to it.
If OVF Tool is installed in a directory where the path contains spaces, the tool may not launch correctly in some circumstances. This issue is resolved in OVF Tool 2.0.1, available on the VMware Web site.

Workaround for OVF Tool 2.0.0: Edit line 23 of the ovftool script to contain the following command: "$OVFTOOL_BIN" "$@"

Top of Page

Before You Begin

Use the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system.
Important: VMware Fusion now requires Mac OS X 10.5 ("Leopard") or later. It will not install on Mac OS X 10.4 ("Tiger").

Installing VMware Fusion 3 will overwrite earlier versions of the application.
It is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time, so if you install VMware Fusion 3 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, the VMware Fusion 3 version replaces the earlier version. This change does not affect your virtual machines. 
If you want to revert to version 2.x or 1.x, you will need to reinstall it.

WDDM is the Windows Display Driver Model for Vista and Windows 7. This is a new feature for VMware Fusion, and development has focused on Aero-specific support and stability. Other 3D games or applications might work, or might experience problems ranging from graphic corruption to crashes. Be sure to save any work in progress before experimenting with 3D games and applications.

Installation Notes

VMware Tools
In order to make the download of VMware Fusion smaller, the VMware Fusion "light" installer (VMware-Fusion-<version-build>-light.dmg) comes bundled only with VMware Tools for Windows and Mac OS X. When you install VMware Tools for another operating system, you will be prompted to let VMware Fusion download VMware Tools from VMware's web site.

If you prefer to download a version of VMware Fusion bundled with all the VMware Tools packages, download the full VMware Fusion installer (VMware-Fusion-<version-build>.dmg or VMware-Fusion-<version-build>.iso).

McAfee Antivirus Products for Mac
There is an incompatibility between certain McAfee Mac antivirus products and VMware Fusion that can cause truncated virtual hard disk files (.vmdk) when you power off your Mac. This can happen with McAfee VirusScan for Mac 8.6.1, McAfee VirusScan for Mac 9.0, and McAfee Security for Mac 1.0.

This problem does not arise if you exclude your virtual machines from McAfee virus scans.

To prevent the virus scanner from scanning your virtual machine directory, take these steps.

On your Mac, open your Applications folder and launch VirusScan.
Click Preferences in the VirusScan for Mac window.
Click More Options.
Select Click lock to make changes.
Select Exclude specific disks, files and folders, and click Add within the Excluded File or Folder section.
Select the Virtual Machines folder within your Documents folder or the location that you store your virtual machines.
Lock your changes and close the window.
The virtual machines will be excluded from being scanned.
Note: The incompatibility relates only to McAfee antivirus products running on the host Mac. Installing McAfee VirusScan Plus in your Windows virtual machines does not affect their virtual hard disks. VMware recommends running antivirus software in your virtual machines.

PC Migration Notes

For some best practices and troubleshooting information, see "Migration Assistant: A Guide" in the VMware Fusion Communities: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11426.

VMware Fusion Migrate Your PC
The Migrate Your PC feature enables you to migrate an existing Windows PC into a VMware Fusion virtual machine. The feature supports Windows PC operating systems from Windows 2000 SP4 (with all critical patches) to Windows 2008 Server (not including R2). You can migrate a PC to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.7.

The VMware Fusion Migration Agent installer must be downloaded from the VMware web site and installed on the source PC. The installer is located at: http://www.vmware.com/go/pc2mac/.
(md5 checksum: 7d25bf73545ae58534720d501adb3177)

Before migrating, make sure your Mac enables guests to connect to shared folders.
One of the steps in the migration process is to enable file sharing on your Mac. In addition, you must allow a guest to connect to the shared folder so that the virtual machine created from your PC can be migrated to the folder. On your Mac, go to System Preferences > Accounts > Guest Account and make sure Allow guests to connect to shared folders is enabled. If this is not enabled, the migration can fail with the message "An error occurred while creating the virtual machine."

Before migrating, you must set the power options on your Windows physical PC so that your monitor and hard disks do not turn off automatically and that your system does not go to standby.

In the Control Panel, click Power Options.
On the Power Schemes panel, set Turn off monitor, Turn off hard drives, and System standby to Never.
Before migrating, you must set a password on your Windows physical PC if it doesn't already have one.
The Migrate Your PC feature requires that the Windows physical PC have a password. You enter the password in the Migration Assistant on your Mac in order to start the migration. If your physical PC does not have a password set, go to User Accounts in the Control Panel and create one.

If you migrate over a wireless connection, set your physical PC's screensaver to wait longer than the migration will take.
The simplest method is to set the wait to 9999.

Right-click on the PC desktop and select Properties.
Select the Screen Saver tab, set Wait to 9999, and click OK.
You cannot use the Migrate Your PC feature on a PC with a web server running on TCP port 443.
This includes users who have installed Microsoft's IIS web server, Apache, or another web server. Users who have installed Visual Studio will also be affected, since it installs Microsoft IIS by default.

If you have a third-party firewall, like ZoneAlarm, you must turn it off before migrating.
Attempting to migrate with a third-party firewall enabled results in a connection error.

You cannot run your PC and a migrated virtual machine at the same time if the PC is a member of an Active Directory domain.
If you migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine, and your PC is a member of an Active Directory domain, you cannot run both the original PC and the migrated virtual machine at the same time because they present the same computer name and system identifier (SID) to the network.
Workaround: change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.

Migrate your PC to a VMware Fusion virtual machine.
After migration completes, but before powering on the migrated virtual machine, shut down the source PC. You want only one machine visible to the network at a time until you change the SID.
Start the migrated virtual machine in VMware Fusion.
Download a utility that can change the SID of your virtual machine. One such utility is NewSID ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx).
Change the SID of the migrated virtual machine.
Tools such as NewSID can cause problems when migrating servers running SQL Server, as discussed here: http://kendalvandyke.blogspot.com/2009/01/changing-machine-sid-with-newsid-breaks.html.

Known Issues with VMware Fusion

The following issues are known to occur in VMware Fusion 3.0.1.

If you have upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard or have used Apple's Migration Assistant to move your system to a new computer, you might have to reinstall VMware Fusion.
In some cases, you might see a Software Update message announcing "A new version of VMware Fusion is available" in which the old and new build numbers are the same. This happens if the OS X install database gets wiped or not migrated, and therefore the VMware Fusion application cannot determine that it is already installed on the system.

Alternatively, you might initiate an update, have it finish immediately, and after restarting VMware Fusion you are prompted for the same update.

Workaround: Reinstall VMware Fusion using the .dmg download image available through the VMware Fusion download page. http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_downloads/vmware_fusion_for_the_mac/3_0.

AVG Free 9 does not work well with VMware Fusion 3.
AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition 9 has high CPU usage after resuming a virtual machine due to its cache server having problems taking up to 100% CPU in Windows. This issue has been reported to AVG.

Workaround: VMware recommends new customers install the included McAfee VirusScan 12-month subscription. Upgrade customers can upgrade to the latest McAfee VirusScan with McAfee, or look at other free antivirus products such as Microsoft Security Essentials.

You can experience keyboard and mouse input delays when you boot a virtual machine running Mac OS X Server 10.6.2.
When the Login window appears, nothing happens immediately when you click the mouse or type. If you wait an extended period after typing or clicking, around a minute, eventually everything you did is replayed and the boot can continue.

VMware mouse driver not installed after importing a Parallels Desktop 5 virtual machine. 
When you import a third-party virtual machine, VMware Fusion automatically installs VMware Tools as the final step in the importation process. However, with a Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac virtual machine, you might see a dialog informing you that the vmmouse.sys driver could not be installed. If this happens, you can successfully install VMware Tools and the mouse driver manually by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools in the VMware Fusion menu bar.

Attempting to mount a dynamic disk prevents the virtual machine from powering on in a Mac running Mac OS X 10.5.8. 
Mounting a dynamic disk is not supported in VMware Fusion. If you attempt this for a virtual machine on a Mac OS X 10.5.8 host, it locks the .vdmk file and prevents the virtual machine from powering on. This problem does not occur with Mac OS X 10.6.

Workaround: Reboot your Mac. This unlocks the file.

Driverless printing does not with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and Ubuntu 9.10.
The VMware virtual printer does not work with RHEL 5.4 and Ubuntu 9.10. 

Workaround: Set up the desired printers separately in the Linux virtual machine.

Do not create nested shared folders with Linux virtual machines.
If you share a folder that is already within a shared folder, the File Browser or the virtual machine can become unresponsive later when you attempt to access the folder.

Workaround: Reboot the virtual machine and remove sharing from one of the folders.

The following issues are reprinted from the VMware Fusion 3.0 release notes. For the complete list of known issues, see http://www.vmware.com/support/fusion3/doc/releasenotes_fusion.html#issues

Installation Issues
User Interface Issues
Guest Operating System Issues
File and Application Sharing Issues
Installation Issues

VMware Fusion installation fails if a broken version of MacFUSE already exists on your Mac.
If your installation of VMware Fusion fails with the message, The following install step failed: run postupgrade script for MacFUSE. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance, it is the result of an unsuccessfully installed version of MacFUSE already on the Mac that left a faulty symlink. To work around this problem you can either install VMware Fusion without MacFUSE or remove the faulty symlink before installing VMware Fusion with MacFUSE. 

To confirm the symlink is faulty, look at the Kind displayed in the Get Info window for the fusefs.fs file.
In the Finder, go to //Library/Filesystems.
Right-click on the file fusefs.fs to display the Get Info window.
—If the Kind is Alias, the symlink is faulty.
—If the Kind is File System Plug-in, the symlink is OK.

To install VMware Fusion without installing MacFUSE:
Restart the installer.
On the Installation Type panel, click Customize to go to the Custom Install pane.
Deselect MacFuse, click Install, and continue with the installation.

To install VMware Fusion with MacFUSE:
In the Finder, go to //Library/Filesystems.
Delete or rename the file fusefs.fs.
Restart the installer and continue with a Standard Install.

You might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive after installing VMware Tools.
After you have upgraded VMware Tools in a Linux guest, VMware Fusion ejects the Tools installer ISO image from the CD/DVD device. However, you might have to reconfigure your virtual CD/DVD drive before you can use the physical CD/DVD device again.

Unable to install VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine.
Installation of VMware Tools NIC driver on Microsoft Vista Enterprise SP1 32-bit Boot Camp virtual machine might fail if you reinstall the Boot Camp partition with another operating system and start up the Boot Camp virtual machine from the Virtual Machine Library.

Workaround: Remove the existing Boot Camp virtual machine from ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines. Start the Boot Camp virtual machine again and install VMware Tools.


User Interface Issues

VMware Fusion does not support Bridged networking to a VPN.
If you attempt to connect to a VPN with Bridged networking in a virtual machine, it might result in a "/dev/vmnet0 is not running" error. If this message appears, lower the network priority of the VPN service on the host. You can do this in System Preferences > Network.

When you create a Windows 7 virtual machine, Windows 7 Aero is not immediately enabled.
Aero is not enabled the first time you start up a Windows 7 virtual machine. To enable Aero, right-click on the desktop, click Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes available in the window.

Virtual machine window might revert to using a single display after you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays.
When you switch to Full Screen view with multiple displays, in some instances the virtual machine window might revert back after 10 seconds to using a single display, and you may observe a few rendering artifacts during this process. Workaround: Wait 30 seconds and retry switching to Full Screen view.

While running a virtual machine in Full Screen view, switching Spaces desktops away from the virtual machine might result in an unexpected switch back to the virtual machine.
This occurs if the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Always Hide is selected. To work around this issue, press Command-Control-Return to exit Full Screen view, then select the menu option View > Full Screen Title Bar > Automatically Show and Hide.

A virtual machine's window might become gray or black and unresponsive when exiting Unity view.
Workaround: Suspend and resume the virtual machine. It should display properly. If not, quit or force quit VMware Fusion, and restart.

Do not upgrade or uninstall VMware Tools in Unity view.
Upgrading or uninstalling VMware Tools while you are working in Unity view can result in garbled windows at the completion of the process.

Workaround: If you find yourself in this situation, restart the virtual machine.

Guest Operating System Issues

In certain cases you cannot log in following a reboot in a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter a password.
Occasionally, you are prevented from logging back in to a Windows XP virtual machine because you cannot enter anything in the password field. If this happens, press Control-Alt-Delete, which brings up the Log On to Windows dialog box. You can type the password in this dialog box and log in. See the Microsoft article on this issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917556.

File and Application Sharing Issues

If you have Microsoft Outlook on your Windows guest, sharing or mirroring your Mac's Documents folder results in it becoming the default location for Outlook attachments and other data.
In a virtual machine with Outlook installed, if you enable shared folders for ~/Documents, VMware Fusion creates an Outlook Temp folder within it and sets it up in the Windows registry as the Outlook temp folder. This makes it easier to open attachments from both the host and the guest.

Shared folders might appear hung if mapped to the host root directory while the host has many mounted drives.
You can select the / (root) level on the host when selecting a shared folder. This might cause problems when trying to browse if the host has many mapped or mounted drives. This problem exists because Windows tries to read every directory before presenting it to the user. If the response time from the mapped or mounted share is slow, shared folders and the host become very sluggish or unresponsive. The more drives that are mapped/mounted, the longer it will take to display the list of directories under the shared folder directory.

Workaround: Disconnect or unmount drives, or map your shared folder at least one level down from root. For example /Users rather than /.

You might get a "File cannot be opened by the host" message when you attempt to open an Outlook attachment in a virtual machine with an application on your Mac.
If you enable ~/Documents as a shared folder while Outlook is running in the virtual machine, an Outlook attachment cannot immediately be opened with an application on the Mac. Workaround: Restart Outlook.

VMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile.
If you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.

Before You Begin

Use the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system

For Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), use version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), use Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.

On VMware Fusion, Leopard provides a richer 3D experience than Tiger.

Installing VMware Fusion 2.0.8 overwrites earlier versions of the application

It is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time. So if you install VMware Fusion 2.0.8 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 2.x or 1.x, VMware Fusion 2.0.8 replaces the earlier versions. To revert to an earlier version, you have to reinstall it.

Top of Page
Resolved Issues

This release resolves the following issue:

A vulnerability in the input validation of VMware Tools update allows for injection of commands.

Upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected
On some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. 

Workaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again.

PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware 
In certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. 

Workaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database.
Start the virtual machine and log in.
Before clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.
In the CMD window, type the following commands:
C:
cd \windows\inf
del infcache.1
exit
Click Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.

DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. 

Workaround: Use VLC Player.

Slow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations
When Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). 

Workaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.

Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 

Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)

Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. 

Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.

Do not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine
If you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.

Upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected
On some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. 
Workaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. 
PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware 
In certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. 

Workaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:
Start the virtual machine and log in.
Before clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.
In the CMD window, type the following commands:
C:
cd \windows\inf
del infcache.1
exit
Click Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.
DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. 
Workaround: Use VLC Player.
Slow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations
When Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). 
Workaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.
Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 
Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) 
Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. 
Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. 
Do not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine
If you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.

Upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected
On some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Usually the drivers for them are silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop; there are just a lot of new ones. 
Workaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to be installed. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again. 
PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware 
In certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine, and the PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens, the New Hardware Found dialog appears every time you reboot and log in. When you try to install the drivers, the install fails. 

Workaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database as follows:
Start the virtual machine and log in.
Before clicking anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe.
In the CMD window, type the following commands:
C:
cd \windows\inf
del infcache.1
exit
Click Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.
DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Windows Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. 
Workaround: Use VLC Player.
Slow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations
When Windows drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). 
Workaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, and then disconnecting the troublesome drives.
Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. 
Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, and disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.) 
Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1 and then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that are imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. 
Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 by clicking: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine. 
Do not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine
If you plug a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which USB 2.0 support is disabled the virtual machine might fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.

Before You Begin

VMware recommends that you do not update your virtual machines to Mac OS X 10.5.6 Server at this time

An OS X Server 10.5.6 guest operating system running in a VMware Fusion 2.0/2.0.1 virtual machine can experience issues in which the you see only a gray window instead of the graphical user interface, and in which USB keyboards and other USB devices do not work with the default setting. To avoid this problem, VMware recommends that you do not update your guest operating system until the next VMware Fusion maintenance software release. Take a snapshot of your OS X Server 10.5.5 virtual machine as a precaution so that you can have a good known state to revert to in case an automatic update to OS X Server 10.5.6 happens.

If a virtual machine has been updated to OS X Server 10.5.6 and there is no snapshot of an OS X Server 10.5.5 in a good known state, there are two workarounds to return some level of functionality to the virtual machine.

For issues with the GUI, disable vmware-tools-guestd following these five steps. You need to have MacFUSE installed as part of the VMware Fusion installations.
Power off the virtual machine.
Browse to the virtual machine in Finder (under ~/Documents/Virtual Machines by default).
Control-click or right-click on the virtual machine, select More > Mount Virtual Disk > Mount All.
Browse to the mounted virtual machine volume in Finder, then go to the virtual machine's /Library/LaunchDaemons folder.
Open the file com.vmware.launchd.tools.plist and change the value of RunAtLoad to false.
For issues with the USB keyboard, open the .vmx file in an editor and edit the USB deviceType:
Change the line 
usb:1.deviceType = "hub" 
to 
usb:1.deviceType = "keyboard"

There is no known fix for enabling other USB devices.

Resolved Issues

The following issues, reported in the VMware Fusion 2.0 release notes or discussed in the user community, have been resolved in 2.0.1:

VMwareUser taking 100% CPU after certain drag-and-drop operations. 
This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.


A number of performance issues for VMware Fusion 2. 
A number of performance issues were identified for VMware Fusion2:
Guest start menu traversal slow when it contains broken shortcuts (Windows XP and earlier only)
High CPU utilization by VMwareUser.exe when first starting up
Slow boot when iSight (product ID 0x8502 as reported by System Profiler) attached to virtual machine
Load time of the Virtual Machine Library on Fusion startup after the first startup
These problems have been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.


Running certain video games and other 3D applications in Fusion 2 on the new MacBook or MacBook Pro, or the MacBook Air, can freeze the Mac. 
This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.


Installing VMware Fusion 2 changes the default browser or other default application. 
In certain cases during installation, VMware Fusion would reassign the first browser it found as the default browser, or reassign another of the default applications for handling URLs. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.

Upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0.1 does not restore already-changed settings, however. You can change the default browser in Safari's Preferences or with the third-party RCDefaultApp. http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/


Take Snapshot incorrectly enabled for some Boot Camp virtual machines. 
VMware Fusion 2.0.1 fixes a problem in which for certain Boot Camp virtual machines, the Take Snapshot button was enabled, which it should not have been.


Gray boxes obscure part of window in Unity view. 
This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.


Daily or weekly AutoProtect snapshots are not being taken. 
VMware Fusion 2.0.1 corrects a problem in which daily or weekly snapshots in AutoProtect were not being taken.


Drag-and-drop does not work if the color depth is set to 16-bit in the guest operating system. 
Having the color depth in Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Vista set to 16-bit no longer prevents dragging-and-dropping.


CVSNT and VMware Tools are incompatible. 
The known incompatibility between CVSNT (http://www.cvsnt.org) and VMware Tools has been fixed. You no longer have to uninstall CVSNT if you want to install VMware Tools to use Unity view, and to use cut-copy-paste or drag-and-drop between your virtual machine and your Mac.


Running Google Earth with 3D acceleration enabled can cause the virtual machine to unexpectedly quit. 
With VMware Fusion 2.0.1, the virtual machine no longer quits unexpectedly when running Google Earth with 3D acceleration enabled, so you do not need to disable 3D acceleration in the VMware Fusion preferences.


Application Dock tile disappears in Unity view after a snapshot. 
The Dock tile for a guest application no longer disappears if you click on it after you take a snapshot in Unity view.


Suspending a virtual machine located on a FileVault encrypted volume makes the system unresponsive. 
For non-English Mac OS X users, when suspending a virtual machine that's stored on a FileVault encrypted volume, Mac OS X might become unresponsive. VMware Fusion 2.0.1 works around this issue.


Drag and drop stops working in a Linux virtual machine after an alert message. 
Previously, if you encountered an alert message while attempting a drag and drop in a Linux virtual machine, you might have had to quit and restart VMware Fusion to get drag-and-drop to work again. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.


Downloading files with Safari in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might fail when using NAT as networking type. 
VMware Fusion 2.0.1 fixes a problem in which using NAT as networking type for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might have resulted in Safari downloads timing out.


With a shared file, moving or copying it to its existing location by a different path can cause data loss. 
Previous to version 2.0.1, VMware Fusion attempted to disable shared folders that would create a risk of data loss if you moved or copied a shared file to its existing location by a different path. With VMware Fusion 2.0.1 the risk of data loss is removed, and VMware Fusion therefore no longer disables shared folders in those situations.


Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine hangs during auto update of Tools. 
When powering on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine that was created in a previous version of VMware Fusion, it was possible for the virtual machine to hang while in the middle of the tools auto upgrade process. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.


Applications that use Multiple Document Interface (MDI), such as Microsoft Excel, might not display correctly in Unity view. 
These applications now display correctly.


In some cases, setting your Mac to "Mirror Displays" results in windows not appearing in Unity view. 
If one of your displays is rotated to vertical (portrait) orientation, or you use a Mac Pro with multiple graphics cards, setting your Mac to mirror displays could cause windows to disappear in Unity view. This problem has been fixed in VMware Fusion 2.0.1.

Known Issues

Mac OS X Server (10.5.5 and earlier) cannot be installed in a virtual machine on the new Fall 2008 MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air.
The Fall 2008 update to the MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air requires a newer version of Mac OS X Server than the most recent version (10.5.5). If you encounter problems installing Mac OS X Server in a virtual machine on these systems, make sure your Mac can boot from the installation disc.


Easy Install doesn't work for Ubuntu 8.10. Ubuntu 8.10 is not officially supported and Easy Install is not available for the guest installation due to the lack of pre-built tools. Perform the standard installation, and install VMware Tools following the Guest Operating System Installation Guide. After VMware Tools is installed, many features should work. If you experience issues with your mouse not ungrabbing, run the Ubuntu Update Manager and ensure that you are running with the latest Ubuntu updates.


Do not install VMware Fusion 2 and CheckPoint SecureClient on the same Mac. 
When both VMware Fusion 2 and SecureClient VPN applications are installed in the Mac, the Mac OS X freezes while booting or shutting down. Do not install both applications on a Mac.

If you have encountered this, follow this workaround to boot up your Mac in Safe Mode and remove one of the applications:
Make sure the Mac is powered off.
Press the power button.
Press and hold the Shift key immediately after you hear the startup tone (but not before).
Release the Shift key when you see the gray Apple and a progress indicator.
Uninstall SecureClient or VMware Fusion.
Reboot the Mac.

VMware Fusion 2 does not directly import Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machines.
Due to a recent change to the Parallels virtual machine file format, VMware Fusion 2 can not directly import Parallels Desktop 4 virtual machines. To work around this, download and install VMware Converter for Windows in your Parallels virtual machine, uninstall Parallels Tools, and run the VMware Converter to import the PC. Detailed steps are at http://www.vmware.com/download/fusion/windows_to_mac.html.


Upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware might trigger many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. 
On some virtual machines created in or ported to VMware Fusion 1, when you upgrade the virtual machine to hardware version 7 in VMware Fusion 2, you see the New Hardware Found wizard at the reboot. This is because hardware version 7 comes with an additional 32 PCI-to-PCI bridge devices. Normally the drivers for them will be silently installed, but on some systems, upgrading a virtual machine's virtual hardware may trigger Windows to show many notifications about PCI-to-PCI bridges being detected. It's not a loop, there are just a lot of new ones. 

Workaround: Click OK on the New Hardware Found dialog and allow them to install. Once all 32 PCI-to-PCI bridges are installed, the dialogs will not show up again.


PCI-to-PCI bridges fail to install following upgrading a virtual machine's hardware. 
In certain circumstances, you might have a corrupted Windows XP driver database in the virtual machine and the PCI-to-PCI bridges will fail to install after you upgrade the virtual machine's hardware. When this happens the New Hardware Found dialog displays every time you reboot and log in, and when you try to install the drivers, the install fails. 

Workaround for Windows XP: Rebuild Windows device driver database by:
Start the virtual machine and log in
Before clicking on anything in the New Hardware Found wizard, go to Start > Run, launch cmd.exe
In the CMD window, type the following commands
C:
cd \windows\inf
del infcache.1
exit
Click Next in the New Hardware Found wizard. All the PCI-to-PCI bridges should install now.

Cannot display images in the GUIMotions plug-in. 
If you use the TMS GUIMotions plug-in for Delphi when writing applications that you want to run in virtual machines, the images for 3D animation are not displayed.


DVD players fail or display an alert when you attempt to play a DVD. 
Because of certain driver issues, DVD players like Microsoft Media Player 11 do not work with VMware Fusion 2. Workaround: Use VLC Player.


Slow boot time for virtual machine when drive letters are mapped to nonexistent locations.
When Windows drive letters are mapped to non-existent locations, the boot time is significantly slower (physical Windows systems have the same issue). Workaround: Unmap unused drive letters by right clicking on Start > My Computer, selecting Disconnect Network Drives, then disconnecting the troublesome drives.


Slow boot of Boot Camp virtual machines caused by a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software.
A slow boot of a Boot Camp virtual machine can be caused by Apple kbdmgr.exe. This is a bug in Apple's Boot Camp software. Workaround: Click Start > Run, then enter msconfig. Click on Startup, then disable kbdmgr.exe. (If you need Apple's keyboard extensions when rebooting into Boot Camp, then re-enable kbdmgr.exe before rebooting.)


Slow boot time for virtual machines imported in VMware Fusion 1, then upgraded to Hardware Version 7 with VMware Fusion 2.
Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 virtual machines that were imported from Parallels or Virtual PC boot extremely slowly if you upgrade them to Hardware Version 7. Workaround: Shut the virtual machine down and downgrade to Hardware Version 6 from the menu: Virtual Machine > Downgrade Virtual Machine.


Do not disable USB 2.0 support for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine.
Plugging a USB device into a host machine when you are running a Mac OS X 10.5.5 virtual machine on which you disabled USB 2.0 support causes the virtual machine to fail. In this situation, VMware Fusion displays the message "The device was unable to connect to its ideal host controller" when you plug in the USB device, and displays the message "The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system" when you click OK to close the previous message. If this happens, go to the USB Devices panel of the Settings window for this virtual machine, and select Enable USB 2.0 support.

Important Note for Users of the New MacBook and MacBook Pro (October 2008), and the MacBook Air

Posted: 27 October 2008

Running certain video games and other 3D applications in Fusion 2 on the new MacBook or MacBook Pro, or the MacBook Air, can freeze the Mac. This is caused by changes resulting from the new drivers that accompany the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT chipsets used in the new Macs.

If you encounter this, a hard reset restores the Mac and the virtual machine to normal.

VMware is working with Apple to address this issue. In the meantime, the following workaround, adding a line to the virtual machine's configuration file (.vmx), prevents the problem from occurring.

Shut down the virtual machine.
In the Finder, select the virtual machine package.
By default, virtual machine packages are located in /Documents/Virtual Machines.
Control-click or right-click the package and choose Show Package Contents.
Select the .vmx file, and control-click or right-click to open it with TextEdit.
Add the line 
mks.gl.shaderMainBodyTemplate = 3
and save the file.

System Requirements for VMware Fusion

The minimum system requirements for installing and using VMware Fusion are:

Any Mac with an Intel 1.5GHz or faster processor
1GB of RAM, 2GB recommended
400MB of free disk space for VMware Fusion, and at least 5GB of free disk space for each virtual machine
Mac OS X version 10.4.11 or higher
Operating system installation media (disk or disk image) for virtual machines
Note: You must have enough memory to run Mac OS X, plus the memory required for each guest operating system and for applications on the Mac and in the virtual machine. See your guest operating system and application documentation for their memory requirements.

Before You Begin

Use the recommended versions of the Mac OS X operating system.
For Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) we recommend version 10.4.11 or higher. For Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) we recommend Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher.

Leopard provides the best 3D experience on VMware Fusion. Running on Tiger results in a comparatively worse 3D experience.

Installing VMware Fusion 2.0 will overwrite earlier versions of the application
It is not possible to have multiple versions of VMware Fusion installed at the same time, so if you install VMware Fusion 2.0 on a machine that already has VMware Fusion 1.x, the 2.0 version replaces the earlier version. If you want to revert to version 1.x, you will need to reinstall it.

Installation Notes

Upgrading Your Virtual Hardware
For best performance after upgrading to VMware Fusion 2.0 from VMware Fusion 1.x, for each virtual machine you need to upgrade its virtual hardware and update with the latest VMware Tools.

VMware Fusion 2.0 introduces the latest generation of virtual hardware, including improved 3D performance. To upgrade to VMware Fusion 2.0 and update your VMware Fusion 1.x virtual machine to take advantage of the latest changes, see below.

IMPORTANT: Virtual hardware changes are like upgrading the motherboard of a physical PC. In some cases, Microsoft Windows may ask you to reactivate your copy of Windows. If this is an issue for you, do not upgrade your virtual hardware to the latest version.

Before installing VMware Fusion 2.0, launch VMware Fusion 1.x
Resume your virtual machine and shut it down cleanly
Quit VMware Fusion 1.x
Install the VMware Fusion 2.0 upgrade
Launch VMware Fusion 2.0, select the virtual machine and choose Upgrade Virtual Machine in the Virtual Machine menu
Start your virtual machine
If the virtual machine was created with VMware Fusion 1.0 (not beta) or later, it should offer to update tools on power on. If not, update VMware Tools manually by going to Update VMware Tools in the Virtual Machine menu
Restart the virtual machine after tools installation is complete
Linux Tools
In the VMware Fusion DMG download, in order to make the download smaller, we only include pre-compiled Linux kernel modules for a selected number of Linux distributions including all that support Linux Easy Install. Note: Source code is included for Linux Tools in the DMG download, so you can still install VMware Tools for any other supported Linux distribution by installing a C compiler and the Linux kernel headers for your running kernel. For the other Linux distributions, go to http://www.vmware.com/download/fusion/drivers_tools.html to download the Linux Tools ISO that contains pre-built modules for all supported Linux guests.

The pre-built modules in the DMG are for:

Mandriva Linux 2008, 2007, 2006
Novell Linux Desktop 9
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 4, 3
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Desktop 10.3, 10.2, 10.1
Turbolinux Desktop 10
Turbolinux Enterprise Server 8
Ubuntu Linux 8.04.1, 8.04, 7.10, 7.04
Tips and Tricks

Tips on using the Mac keyboard
If you are unfamiliar with Mac keyboards, the following tips will help you send keystrokes that you know from PC keyboards to virtual machines:

To send the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keystroke combination to a virtual machine, do one of the following:
From the Virtual Machine menu, select Send Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
If you are using an external PC keyboard, press Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
On a full-sized Mac keyboard, press Control-Option-. The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.
On a Mac laptop keyboard, press Fn-Ctrl-Option-Delete.
The delete key on Apple keyboards is actually the backspace key to all other operating systems. To send the Del key to a virtual machine:
On a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-Delete.
On a full-sized Mac keyboard, press . The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.
Mac keyboards do not have an obvious Insert key. To send the Insert key to a virtual machine:
On a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-M.
On a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the Help key.
Mac keyboards do not have a PRINT SCREEN key. To send the PRINT SCREEN key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press F13.

U.S. Mac keyboards do not have an AltGr key. To send the AltGr key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the right Option key.
AltGr is supported on European MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards. The Enter key next to the right Command key (otherwise known as the numeric pad Enter key) is remapped to AltGr on Mac laptops.

By default, VMware Fusion maps Control-click to a right mouse click. To disable this, go to the menu VMware Fusion > Preferences > Keyboard & Mouse > Mouse Shortcuts and unselect the Control - Primary Button mouse shortcut.
Known Issues with VMware Fusion

VMware Tools does not work well with Ubuntu 8.10.
Although VMware Tools can be installed on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 8.10, much of the functionality afforded by VMware Tools does not work. VMware does not recommend using Ubuntu 8.10 as a guest operating system in VMware Fusion 2.0 for now. Future patch releases of VMware Fusion should address these issues


Accessing Shared Folders might be slow in some instances.
In some cases, accessing Shared Folders is slow initially and when entering new folders. This is due to an interaction with Microsoft networking when accessing your Shared Folders using the Desktop shortcut or by navigating to the Shared Folder as a network drive (\\.host\Shared Folders).

To work around this Shared Folders pausing issue, map your Shared Folders to a Windows mapped drive letter and only access them using the drive letter. For new virtual machines, VMware Fusion automatically creates this mapped drive letter to Shared Folders for you. In case you don't have this mapped drive letter, do the following to create it:
Open the My Computer window, go to the Tools menu and select Map Network Drive
Enter \\.host\Shared Folders\ as the Folder and click Finish
Remove any previous shortcuts to Shared Folders on the desktop and create a new shortcut to the mapped drive letter
Accessing your Shared Folders as a mapped drive letter should no longer have the long pause you may see by accessing it as a network drive (\\.host\Shared Folders).


CVSNT and VMware Tools are incompatible. 
There is a known incompatibility between CVSNT (http://www.cvsnt.org) and VMware Tools. You should uninstall CVSNT if you want to install VMware Tools to use Unity view, and to use cut-copy-paste or drag-and-drop between your virtual machine and your Mac.


The McAfee anti-virus ISO remains mounted.
If you start the installation of McAfee VirusScan Plus, the McAfee ISO remains mounted, which can lead to two problems.
If you cancel the installation and later try to install the bundled anti-virus again, either by clicking Install when the anti-virus prompt appears, or by selecting Virtual Machine > Install McAfee VirusScan Plus, nothing will happen. These commands actually mount the ISO, but leave the launching of the anti-virus installer to the autorun. Because the ISO is already mounted, the autorun is not triggered. To work around this, eject the mounted anti-virus ISO image by selecting Virtual Machine > CD/DVD > Disconnect CD/DVD. Then select Virtual Machine > Install McAfee VirusScan Plus to start the McAfee VirusScan Plus installer again.
Because the anti-virus ISO image is occupying the virtual CD/DVD drive, if you insert a CD/DVD on your Mac the CD/DVD will not be mounted in the virtual machine, even if you have set the CD/DVD drive to be attached to the virtual machine. To work around this, go to Virtual Machine > CD/DVD > Use Physical Drive to force mount the disc.

Running Google Earth with 3D acceleration enabled can cause the virtual machine to unexpectedly quit. 
To work around this issue, disable 3D acceleration in the VMware Fusion preferences.


Mac OS X Server virtual machines do not run on 32-bit Mac hardware. 
VMware Fusion does not support OS X Server virtual machines on 32-bit CPUs.


In some cases, setting your Mac to "Mirror Displays" results in windows not appearing in Unity view. 
If you set your Mac to mirror displays—for multiple displays or for a TV or projector, for instance—virtual machine windows might not appear properly in Unity view.


Application Dock tile disappears in Unity view after a snapshot.
The Dock tile for a guest application might disappear if you click on it after you take a snapshot in Unity view. Although the Dock tile disappears as if the application has quit, the application is still running. To restore the Dock tile to the Dock, exit Unity view and reenter.


VMware Tools are not upgraded in a Windows Me virtual machine. 
If you power on a Windows Me virtual machine created with VMware Fusion 1.x and attempt to upgrade VMware Tools, the upgrade is not successful, being unable to install certain drivers. It might be necessary to force quit VMware Fusion and restart the virtual machine before you can perform a successful upgrade.


The Ubuntu shut down window does not appear in Unity view. 
If you choose System > Quit in an Ubuntu virtual machine while in Unity view, the shut down window does not appear. To work around this, exit Unity view, press tab until the desired button on the shut down window is chosen and press return.


Drag and drop stops working in a Linux virtual machine after an alert message.
If you encounter an alert message while attempting a drag and drop in a Linux virtual machine, you might have to quit and restart VMware Fusion to get drag-and-drop to work again. This can be the result of a file permission issue, or some other issue, like if you have created a symbolic link, using Terminal, in the Mac and have dragged it to a Linux virtual machine.


VMware Fusion does not support mirrored folders and other guest-host integration features when the guest user account is a roaming user profile. 
If you are logged in under a roaming user profile you can select to mirror folders in VMware Fusion, but no mirroring takes place. VMware Fusion does not display an alert when this happens. Other problems include not setting default URL handlers inside the virtual machine or to launch an application in the Mac from the virtual machine.


Resizing a window in a Solaris 10 Update 3 virtual machine might not work in some cases. 
When resizing the virtual machine window, the resolution autofits if the window size is smaller than the resolution set during configuration of VMware Tools, but won't autofit if the window size is larger than that resolution. In addition, if you switch the virtual machine to full screen view while its window size is larger than the configured resolution, the display does not expand to cover the entire screen. This problem does not occur with Solaris 10 Update 4.


Default applications don't work if application sharing is not enabled in VMware Fusion preferences.
Setting default applications in the VMware Fusion preferences Default Applications pane will not work if application sharing has not been set in the Settings window for a virtual machine. Make sure that the Sharing settings for the virtual machine have the checkbox Allow the virtual machine to open applications on your Mac enabled. Otherwise, the default applications set for handling URLs in the virtual machine won't be modified, and will not open links on the Mac.


VMware Fusion doesn't run a new Boot Camp partition in certain cases.
If you create a Boot Camp partition on a Mac that previously had a Boot Camp partition that you deleted, VMware Fusion can't run the new Boot Camp partition. This is because VMware Fusion has retained some files relating to the previous partition. 

To work around this problem
Quit VMware Fusion and go to ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp
Delete Boot Camp
Restart VMware Fusion and run the installer for the new partition

QuickTime video might not work in Full Screen view. 
Occasionally, on Windows guests, when you try to play a QuickTime video in Full Screen view, you see only a black screen.


Downloading files with Safari in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might fail when using NAT as networking type. 
Using NAT as networking type for a Mac OS X Server virtual machine might result in Safari downloads timing out. This is a bug in Safari. This does not happen with scp or curl. Workaround: For downloading in Safari, select Bridged for your networking type to connect directly to the physical network. Choose Virtual Machine > Settings, select Network, and select Bridged on the Network panel.


Viewports are not updated in 3ds Max 2009.
Viewports do not display or refresh properly. To prevent this problem, do the following.
Open 3ds Max, go to Customize > Preferences > Viewports > Configure Driver
Deselect Use Incremental Scene Updates and click OK.

Disable screen saver and sleep before using Unity view in Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Having a screen saver or sleep enabled when in Unity view in these two operating systems results in the virtual machine powering off at the idle time out.


Do not enter Unity view if the User Account Control confirmation window is displayed. 
In a Microsoft Vista virtual machine, do not enter Unity view while the User Account Control (UAC) confirmation window is open. If you do, the resolution does not adjust correctly and your windows will be able only to move within an area as big as the virtual machine window before entering Unity view. The workaround is to exit and reenter Unity view.


If a proxy application is no longer available in a virtual machine, it might still be assigned to open files or URL types on the host Mac.
If you uninstall an application in the virtual machine that has been assigned a role in the host, attempting to launch the proxy application from the host can power on the virtual machine, but VMware Fusion does not display an alert that the application is not available. If you revert to a snapshot of the virtual machine that doesn't have the application, the same thing happens. Uninstalling VMware Tools might have this result as well.


Sometimes VMware Fusion does not open a file or link with a default application.
There are a number of cases where VMware Fusion, by design, does not open a default application and presents an alert stating "file on the host cannot be opened from inside of guest." VMware Fusion does not open files or links if the proxy application set on the host points to within the same virtual machine where the request originated. Also, VMware Fusion presents the alert if no application exists on the host that can open the file in the virtual machine.


A guest operating system with four vCPUs cannot be reset from the Virtual Machine menu.
Using Reset from the Virtual Machine menu to reset a guest operating system with four vCPUs can result in an alert stating the virtual machine cannot be powered on. If this occurs, simply power on the virtual machine again. (This issue does not affect Windows and Linux guests for which VMware Tools have been installed.)


Some Linux applications do not start from a virtual machine's Applications menu.
When in Unity view on a Linux guest you might not be able to start some applications from a virtual machine's Applications menu on the host. For some applications, the application might show a fatal error at startup and for others, the application does not start.

Workaround: Do one of the following:
On Open SUSE guests, use a text editor to open the file named /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.common. Search for and delete the block of lines starting with Beginning of the block added by the VMware software and ending with End of the block added by the VMware software.
On Debian and Ubuntu guests, find and delete the file named /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99-vmware-vmware_user (or similar).
If you are using xdm, use a text editor to open the files named xdm-config in /etc/X11/xdm, /usr/lib/X11/xdm, /usr/local/lib/X11/xdm, and so on. Search for and delete the block of lines starting with Beginning of the block added by the VMware software and ending with End of the block added by the VMware software.

Moving the menu bar to another display while using multiple displays in Full Screen view might result in the virtual machine window going blank.
When you are using very large topologies, greater than 4096 x 4096, changing the location of the menu bar from one display to another can stop the virtual machine window from being rendered. Switching to Single Window view and back enables the virtual machine to recover, as can doing a suspend and resume of the guest.


Guest operating system does not change to fit resized virtual machine window.
On Windows 95 and Windows 98 guests, resizing the virtual machine's window does not cause the guest operating system to adjust its resolution to fit unless you use the guest's Display Properties settings to change the screen resolution to a higher value than 640 X 480.


Using "Safely Remove Hardware" for an HID USB device sometimes results in disconnecting the USB Controller. 
In some cases, using the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the Windows taskbar's notification area to disconnect a USB device can cause the entire USB Controller and all other devices attached to that USB Controller to be removed. This applies only to bootable HIDs (usually mice, keyboards, and tablets)—other USB devices can be disconnected with Safely Remove Hardware. 

If this happens, shut down your virtual machine, go to the USB panel of the Virtual Machine settings window and configure the virtual machine to add back the removed controller.


Manually connect USB devices when you use Unity view. 
The Automatically connect USB Devices setting does not apply to a virtual machine in Unity view, by design. To connect a USB device to a virtual machine in Unity view, choose Virtual Machine > USB in the VMware Fusion menu for that virtual machine, and choose the USB device to connect.


Working offline messages and synchronization error messages can appear if mirrored folders is enabled.
Using mirrored folders might, in some cases, cause Windows to incorrectly view a folder as an inaccessible network share and assume it is offline. This results in failed attempts to synchronize data or messages about no longer being connected to a drive.

Workaround: Open a Windows Explorer window, Choose Tools > Folder Options and click the Offline Files tab. Deselect Enable Offline Files and restart the virtual machine.


In certain cases, unmirroring "My Music" will not work after upgrading to the release version of VMware Fusion 2 from a Beta 2 or RC version.
This does not happen for anyone installing VMware Fusion 2.0 for the first time. In certain cases with a Windows XP virtual machine running in VMware Fusion 2.0 after it has been upgraded to the release version, deselecting Music in Mirrored Folders on the Sharing window does not prevent the My Music folder being shared with the Mac. To fix this you must change a value in User Shared Folder in the guest.

Workaround:
In the virtual machine, select Run from the start menu.
Run regedit.
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
Change the "My Music" value from \\.host\Shared Folders\My Music to %USERPROFILE\My Documents\My Music (this varies by language and is only true for Windows XP)
Log out of the guest and log back in.

With a shared file, moving or copying it to its existing location by a different path can cause data loss.
If a file is located in a shared or mirrored folder, and you move or copy it to the same location but accessed through a different path, this results in the file being lost. An example of where this could happen is if the Desktop is mirrored at the same time as the Mac home folder is shared, and you attempt to move or copy a file from the desktop to the shared home folder/Desktop directory. This causes the file to overwrite itself with garbage content. Because of this potential problem, VMware Fusion attempts to disable shared folders that create this risk. If a shared folder is automatically disabled, do not re-enable it unless you know what you're doing. Drag-and-drop is also disabled for files that are located in shared or mirrored folders. Moving, copying, or dragging and dropping files that are not located in shared or mirrored folders is not affected by this problem.


3DMark fails to run with 3DMark error: "DirectX error message . . ."
If the resolution of a display mode in a virtual machine is larger than that of the Mac, VMware Fusion resizes the window down to fit in the Mac display. This can cause an error message when you open 3DMark, although if you then quit and reopen 3DMark it launches fine. If you use 3DMark, have a host resolution that is larger than the display mode being set by any of the 3DMarks.


Mac OS X bug causes Mac to lock up under heavy I/O activity. 
In some cases your Mac can become unresponsive after heavy I/O activity. This is an acknowledged Apple bug; Apple plans to include the fix in Mac OS X 10.5.5.


Install Novell Linux Desktop 9 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical installation program to install Novell Linux Desktop 9. This fails. When installing Novell Linux Desktop 9, use the text mode.


Oversaturated colors in Age of Empires III.
In Age of Empires III on a virtual machine, the colors of certain elements in the window might be oversaturated, in some cases going to white.

To work around this problem:
In Age of Empires III, choose Help & Tools > Option > Graphics Options
Deselect Bloom Effect and click OK

Printing cannot be enabled if the virtual machine has more than one serial port configured already.
If you have already added two or more serial ports to a virtual machine, you cannot enable a printer on the Printers panel of the VMware Fusion Settings window.

Install Red Hat Linux 7.0 using text mode only.
Do not use the graphical, mouse-based installation program to install Red Hat Linux 7.0. This can fail into a black screen. When installing Red Hat Linux 7.0, use the text mode for installation.


Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine hangs during auto update of Tools.
When powering on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 virtual machine that was created in a previous version of VMware Fusion, it is possible for the virtual machine to hang while in the middle of the tools auto upgrade process. If you encounter this issue please shut down the virtual machine and power it back on. The virtual machine should boot without problems the second time. At this point uninstall and then reinstall tools to ensure that they function properly.


The Applications menu does not provide access to the standard folders listed there for Windows 2000 Server. In some cases, choosing the My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, or Printers items in the Applications menu does not display the corresponding window.


The first boot of a newly imported Windows 2000 virtual machine can take a long time.
Part of the process of booting up a newly imported virtual machine entails finding new hardware. This takes a long time on a Windows 2000 virtual machine, and the dialogs that relate to this process are obscured by the Tools installer dialog. This can result in the user thinking the installer is stuck when it is not. All subsequent boots of the virtual machine proceed at a normal pace.


Trying to browse Microsoft Windows Network (WINS) while in NAT mode might result in an error message.
Possible error messages include "The specified network is no longer available" and "The semaphore timeout period has expired." The workaround is to go to the Network panel in System Preferences on the Mac and delete and recreate your Location. This issue does not arise in Bridged mode.


VMDKMounter does not mount partitioned dynamic disk VMDK.


VMDKMounter mounts NTFS hard disks as read-only.
VMDKMounter depends on the Mac OS X file system support to mount virtual disk volumes. By default, Mac OS X comes with read-write support for FAT and HFS+ formatted volumes, and read-only support for NTFS formatted volumes.

To add read-write support for NTFS volumes, you can install NTFS-3G separately. Note that installing NTFS-3G may prevent Startup Disk from recognizing your Boot Camp partition, as well as cause files with non-English names to be unreadable.

If you do install NTFS-3G, you can boot into Boot Camp: you will need to hold down the Option key at startup.


Dragging an RTF file from the guest to Microsoft Word 2008 in the host causes the Word application to close unexpectedly.
Avoid dragging and dropping RTF files onto Word in the host. If you drag the file onto Word again after restarting the application, however, the file will be able to be opened.


Logging in after having turned off mirroring for the Desktop folder when logged off produces an alert.
This happens if you have logged out of the current user account while mirrored Desktop was enabled, but then turned off mirroring for the Desktop while logged out. Changing the setting results, when logging back in, in an alert saying the location of the folder can't be found. When you click OK, however, the settings are fixed and things will work as expected.


Incorrect security flaw message appears when you do something with shared folders.
In Windows XP with certain versions of Internet Explorer 6, you might see a "This page has an unspecified potential security flaw" message when you navigate between certain shared folders or drag and drop a file or folder onto a mirrored folder. The correct dialog box for these instances should contain a "copy/move from this zone" query. Internet Explorer 7 fixes this problem, so the recommendation is to upgrade to it.


Default browser set in a virtual machine prevents any other browser from being a choice in default applications.
In certain cases, having a particular application set as your default browser prevents other browser applications from being able to be seen as a choice for handling any of the common protocols, like http, https, ftp, and so on.


The VMware Fusion menu bar in Full Screen view might stop responding after you choose Help.
In certain cases, the VMware Fusion menu bar might cease to work in Full Screen view. This happens if you choose Help. Use the keyboard shortcut Control-Command-Return to exit Full Screen view, after which you can return to Full Screen view with the menu working. You can also use Command-Tab to switch to another application, after which the VMware Fusion menu becomes responsive although still in Full Screen view.


Internet Explorer in Vista virtual machine can't find the path to a file on the Mac host.
If you attempt to open an HTML file on the Mac host using Internet Explorer 7 in a Vista guest (either by setting the file to open with Internet Explorer as a shared application or by double-clicking on the file in a shared folder from the virtual machine), Internet Explorer launches, but displays an alert saying it can't find the path to the file. This is the result of the Vista/Internet Explorer default security settings. To make opening the file work, "Protected Mode" must be disabled for the local intranet zone, and \\.host needs to be added to the list of safe sites.

Workaround:
Open Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options.
Click the Security tab and select the Local intranet zone (not Internet).
Click Sites, then Advanced, type \\.host and click Add, then Close and OK.
Back in the Local intranet settings, deselect Enable Protected Mode.
Click OK, and accept the warning, "The current security settings will put your computer at risk," by clicking OK again.
Close Internet Explorer to apply the change.

Internet Explorer will now open files from \\.host correctly.


A designated shared application does not launch in a powered off virtual machine.
If a virtual machine is powered off and it contains an application used by other virtual machines or the host as the designated shared application for opening files or URLs, when you open one of those files or URLs, the virtual machine will resume, but the application will not launch automatically. However, once the virtual machine is running, trying to open the files or URLs again works.


Cannot drag and drop a file directly to the host from a network drive in Ubuntu.
In Ubuntu 7.04 and Ubuntu 7.10, you can't drag and drop a file directly from a network drive in your virtual machine to your Mac. The workaround is to drop the file on your Ubuntu desktop, then drag and drop it to the Mac.


Shared Folders permissions might be too restrictive in Linux and Mac OS X Server guests.
These problems might consist of not getting write access, or getting an "access denied" message. The uid and gid of the guest needs to match that of the host. You get the uid of your Mac host by opening Terminal and running id. 

Workaround for Linux: Edit the /etc/fstab entry for the shared folder and add uid=XXX,gid=YYY to the options column, where XXX and YYY are the uid and gid to be used for the guest user.

Workaround for Mac OS X Server:
Go to /Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/services.sh
Modify the line mount -t vmhgfs .host:/ '/Volumes/Shared Folders' to look like
mount -t vmhgfs -o uid=<XXX> .host:/ '/Volumes/Shared Folders' 
where XXX is the uid to be used for the guest user.
Run sudo '/Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/services.sh' --restart

Cannot install VMware Tools in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine if there is a CD already connected.
Having a CD connected to the virtual machine interferes with VMware Fusion being able to install VMware Tools. Before you select Install VMware Tools, make the Mac OS X Server guest eject all CDs, for example by drag-and-dropping the CD icons on your guest desktop to the guest Trash icon.


Cannot run an executable if it is in a shared folder in a Mac OS X Server virtual machine.


Some games with SecuROM copy protection might refuse to install with VMware Fusion.


Importing a Boot Camp partition for the first time can result in it getting stuck in the processing stage the first time you start it up.
VMware Fusion allows you to import your Boot Camp partition into an independent virtual machine that no longer relies on the Boot Camp partition itself. However, if you import the Boot Camp partition and immediately run the Boot Camp partition itself as a virtual machine, the Boot Camp partition can become stuck in the "preparing" phase. If this happens, force quit Fusion, restart your Mac, and restart Fusion. The Boot Camp partition can then be run as a virtual machine, will prompt for your password, and preprocessing will complete in a timely fashion.


Flat Hard-Disk Image Cannot Be Imported.
VMware Importer does not import Virtual PC virtual machines with any flat hard-disk images. If you attempt to import such a virtual machine, VMware Importer reports that the virtual disk is corrupt.


Reconfiguring the CPUs on an imported virtual machine results in an error.
Some virtual machines imported from Microsoft Virtual PC or Parallels Desktop for Mac will not work with more than one CPU, so don't customize the import by changing the Processor configuration to two. Changing the CPU setting to two virtual processors while importing a virtual machine results in an error when you start up the virtual machine. You see the message, "The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this time." If you get this error, go to the Settings pane and change the Processors setting back to one virtual processor.


Enabling or disabling printers for a running virtual machine does not take effect immediately.
Selecting or deselecting the Enabled check box on the Printers sheet in Settings does not add or remove printers if the virtual machine is running. To change the setting for printers and have it take effect, you must power off the operating system in the virtual machine, make the change, and power the operating system back on.


Overlapping windows have redraw issues in Exposé.
Overlapping windows in Exposé have redraw issues with only the top most non-overlapping windows showing correctly.


For networking to work properly in your virtual machines, reboot your Mac after upgrading its operating system, or after using the Migration Assistant.
After upgrading from Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) to Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), you must to reboot your Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion. Similarly, after using Apple's Migration Assistant to move your data and applications from one Mac to another, you will need to reboot the new Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion.


Conflict in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) between VMware Fusion and anti-virus software can cause memory corruption.
Running a virtual machine in VMware Fusion creates a .vmem file either inside the virtual machine's package, or in /tmp/vmware-. If you are running Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger), and the Norton AntiVirus' Auto-Protect feature scans the .vmem file while the virtual machine is running, host memory corruption can occur. The problem described here has been reproduced with Norton AntiVirus, but it is possible that the problem could occur with other anti-virus or backup software as well.

Upgrade to Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) to avoid this problem altogether.

To prevent this conflict from occurring in Mac OS X 10.4, exclude both the Virtual Machines folder and the /tmp/vmware-<YourUserName> folder from the Norton AntiVirus SafeZones (System Preferences > Norton Auto-Protect > Safe Zones > Everywhere EXCEPT in).

A typical symptom of this problem is that when you try to suspend the virtual machine, it gets stuck, and VMware Fusion can no longer run virtual machines. To recover from that situation:
Shut down the host operating system as soon as possible and restart it.
Prevent the conflict from occurring as described above.
Discard the .vmss file for the affected virtual machine. Note: Whatever state was saved in the last suspend is lost.
Boot up the virtual machine.

No audio can be heard in virtual machines created with some very old guest operating systems.
Old operating systems, such as DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95, may not have drivers for the virtual ES1371 sound device that Fusion presents. Other VMware products optionally present a Sound Blaster 16 device for these guests, but Fusion does not have this capability. This clarification also applies to previous versions of VMware Fusion.


Creating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 might fail if there is insufficient memory.
Before creating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 as its guest operating system, ensure that you have enough memory assigned to the virtual machine to complete the process. You need 490MB and an additional 50MB for each NIC. For instance, if you were creating a virtual machine with two NICs, you would need to assign a minimum of 590MB to have a successful virtual machine creation.


Turbolinux 10 Server does not reboot automatically after installation in a virtual machine.
At the end of the installation of Turbolinux 10 Server in a virtual machine, when you click Finish the system does not reboot and the screen becomes black. This results from a problem Turbolinux has switching from X to VGA. Workaround: Press the Enter key to continue with the reboot.


Microsoft Money 2006 does not update financial information over the internet if its data file is stored on a Shared Folder.
This problem does not occur with Microsoft Money 2008. For Microsoft Money 2006, there are two workarounds: 1) Store the Microsoft Money file in the virtual disk of the virtual machine; or 2) Enable Windows File Sharing on your Mac's System Preferences, share the folder that contains your Microsoft Money data file, and mount the Mac's network share in the virtual machine to access it.


Using the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.
If this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.
To help VMware better understand what happens in this case, please file a support incident that includes your Boot Camp logs. The logs can be found in your home folder as the file
~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Helper/naos-1.0.vmwarevm/vmware.log
Please note that the folder naos-1.0.vmwarevm is a package. If you are opening it with Finder, right-click the icon and select Show Package Contents.


Applications that use Multiple Document Interface (MDI), such as Microsoft Excel, might not display correctly in Unity view.


Unity view is not supported when more than one user is logged in to Windows. 
Fast User Switching is not compatible with Unity view.


When you cancel a drag-and-drop operation between the Mac host and a virtual machine, it may take several seconds before another drag-and-drop operation is possible. 
The virtual machine guest operating system can require several seconds to cancel a drag-and-drop operation. When you attempt a drag-and-drop operation, a plus sign (+) should appear on the file or folder you are dragging and dropping. If the plus sign does not appear, the virtual machine could be processing a prior operation. Wait a few seconds and try again.


In virtual machines running Linux distributions with kernel versions lower than 2.4, VMware Fusion does not support drag and drop operations between the virtual machine and the host.


If you are installing Microsoft Windows Vista from multiple installation disks, Windows Easy Install does not work.
To install Vista from multiple installation disks, use the standard installation: in the New Virtual Machine Assistant, when the Windows Easy Install panel is displayed, deselect Use Easy Install and click Continue to proceed with the standard installation.


Powering on multiple virtual machines (whose combined memory allocation exceeds that of the host physical system) can slow the system.
If the memory allocated to running virtual machines approaches or exceeds the physical memory available on the host, the system can become very slow. This can happen with one or more virtual machines running. Make sure to only power on virtual machines that have memory allocations that your host machine can handle. If you encounter this problem, close one or more virtual machines. You might also consider reducing the memory allocation of some of your virtual machines (Virtual Machine > Settings > System Hardware > Memory).


On Macs with more than one CD-ROM drive (internal or external), physical CD-ROM drives cannot be moved between running virtual machines.
This occurs when two or more virtual machines are powered on, and one of the physical CD-ROM drive is connected to one of the powered-on virtual machines. If you disconnect the physical CD-ROM drive from the virtual machine, and then attempt to connect the CD-ROM drive to one of the other powered-on virtual machines, the connection fails.

To work around this problem, reset the virtual machines.


Virtual machines stored on drives formatted with FAT32 may crash in VMware Fusion.
This problem is accompanied by the error message: Argument list too long.
Testing suggests that this problem may indicate a corrupted disk.


Migrating Linux virtual machines between Intel and AMD hosts. 
VMware recommends you do not migrate a Linux virtual machine between hosts when one host is running on an AMD processor and the other is running on an Intel processor.

During installation, many distributions of Linux choose a kernel that is optimized for the specific processor on which it is being installed, and some distributions install a generic kernel by default, but provide architecture-specific kernels that the user can choose to install. The kernel might contain instructions that are available only on that processor. These instructions can have adverse effects when run on a host with the wrong type of processor.


For 64-bit SUSE Linux versions lower than 10.1, VMware virtual machines support the X graphical windows system only if you have installed VMware Tools in the virtual machine.


Fixing sound problems in virtual machines running Vista 32-bit edition 
When you install Microsoft Vista 32-bit edition in a VMware Fusion virtual machine, there is no sound output. To correct this problem, run Windows Update to update the sound driver from within Vista. 

To update the sound driver in a VMware Fusion virtual machine running Windows Vista 32-bit edition:
In the virtual machine, from the Windows start menu, right-click Computer and select Properties.
In the left pane, under Tasks, select Device Manager.
When prompted for your permission to continue, click Continue.
Windows displays the Device Manager.
Right-click the Multimedia Sound Adapter with a warning symbol (indicating that there is no driver) and select Update Driver Software.
At the prompt How do you want to search for driver software?, select Search automatically for updated driver software. 
Windows finds and installs the appropriate driver for your virtual sound card.
When you are prompted to restart, click Restart Now.
Sound should now work in your Microsoft Vista 32-bit virtual machine.

Sound does not work in virtual machines running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2. 
To enable sound in a virtual machine running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2, you must enable the Windows Audio Service: open the Sounds and Audio Devices Control Panel. Windows prompts you to enable the audio device. When you enable the device, Windows reboots. Sound should now work in the virtual machine.

Key Features of VMware Fusion

VMware Fusion is a desktop application that lets you create and run virtual machines on your Intel-based Mac. VMware's first product for the new Intel Macs makes it easier than ever to take advantage of the security, flexibility, and portability of virtual machines. VMware Fusion provides an intuitive user interface for creating virtual machines, and for running preconfigured virtual machines created with VMware Workstation, VMware Server, and ESX Server. With VMware Fusion, you can run your favorite Windows applications on your Mac. You can also download virtual machines from the VMware Technology Network (VMTN) Web site, which has a growing library of virtual appliances with a wide range of pre-installed and preconfigured applications and operating systems.

Features of VMware Fusion:

You can use 32-bit and 64-bit guest operating systems in VMware Fusion virtual machines. VMware Fusion supports Windows, Linux, and Solaris operating systems in virtual machines.
Your virtual machines can have multiple virtual processors, taking advantage of the Intel Core Duo chips in today's newest Intel Macs.
VMware Fusion supports high-speed USB 2.0 for a huge range of devices. Even devices that do not have drivers for Mac OS X will work in a virtual machine.
Virtual machines seamlessly integrate with your Mac: you can cut and paste text between your Mac and your virtual machines, drag and drop files, and create shared folders on your computer so you can easily share files and folders.
Unity view displays your Windows virtual machine applications directly on your Mac desktop. The virtual machine window is hidden, and your virtual machine applications are displayed in the Mac dock, so you can use them just as you use your native Mac applications. See Using Unity View.
You can burn CDs or DVDs to your Mac's rewritable optical drive from within your virtual machine.
Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.3

VMware Fusion 1.1.3 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a variety of issues.

VMware Fusion 1.1.3:

Corrects a problem in which VMware Fusion encountered reactivation problems in the native Boot Camp partition and the Boot Camp virtual machine when installing Windows Vista SP1.
Fixes a problem in VMware Fusion 1.1.2 that caused HGFS mounting failures in Linux guest operating systems.
Fixes a problem where VMware Fusion did not distinguish between Traditional and Simplified Chinese so that if your system language preference was set to either Chinese version, Fusion would present the Simplified Chinese interface. In verison 1.1.3, Fusion differentiates between the two Chinese systems and enables the user to specify another language as a preference if Traditional Chinese is not available.
Updates the Simplified Chinese on-line help.
Corrects a problem in which a virtual machine originally created with a product other than Fusion got the error "Cannot connect virtual device sound" when it tried to play a sound.
VMware Fusion 1.1.1 incorporated a workaround for Apple bug 5679432 (Mac OS X hang under heavy disk load when unbuffered I/O is in use). That version of Fusion disabled unbuffered disk I/O on Mac OS X 10.5 hosts, even if the user selected Optimize for Mac OS application performance in VMware Fusion preferences. Apple fixed this bug in Mac OS X 10.5.3, so VMware Fusion 1.1.3 removes the workaround when the guest operating system is Mac OS X 10.5.3 or higher.
Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.2

VMware Fusion 1.1.2 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a variety of issues.

VMware Fusion 1.1.2:

Corrects a problem in which the remapping of keyboard shortcuts in Full Screen or Single Window view could not be disabled. Deselecting Enable Mac OS keyboard shortcuts now works as expected.
Fixes a problem that could arise when the user attempted to run a virtual machine with the virtual CD drive connected but without a drive connected to the Mac. This problem was most likely to happen on a MacBook Air. The virtual machine no longer fails in this situation.
Adds support for Windows XP SP3 when importing a Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.
Fixes a problem that prevented the user from being able to burn CDs with a USB Superdrive on the MacBook Air.
Fixes a problem that caused VMware Fusion to fail when the user pressed some newly introduced keys on the new slim Apple keyboard, if the Enable debugging checks preference was set.
Corrects a problem in which VMware Fusion occasionally would not return a USB device to Mac OS control when a virtual machine was shut down. VMware Fusion now makes sure to disconnect the device from the virtual machine, making it available to the Mac.
Fixes a compatibility problem with wireless bridging and DHCP/routing behavior that could prevent a virtual machine from getting an IP address in certain cases.
Corrects a sound problem in which only the default speaker worked in certain cases.
In some cases, VMware Fusion, after being upgraded to Version 1.1.1, would fail with a Signal 10 error when the user tried to use the keyboard. This problem has been fixed.
Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) no longer causes memory corruption. Version 1.1.2 contains a fix for the problem described in security advisory VMSA-2008-0005.html, section i.
VMware Fusion 1.1.2 and Mac OS X Leopard Time Machine Issue Resolved

A bug in the Mac OS X 10.5-10.5.1 operating systems caused the system to fail if Time Machine attempted to back up live virtual machines. To avoid this, VMware Fusion 1.1 excluded all virtual machines from Time Machine backups. Apple resolved the Time Machine bug in Mac OS X 10.5.2, so VMware Fusion 1.1.2 now allows Time Machine backups of virtual machines if the Mac is running Mac OS X 10.5.2 or higher. This may result in larger Time Machine backups. If the backups are now too large, you can manually exclude your virtual machines from Time Machine backup and copy them separately to your backup disk.
Issues Resolved in VMware Fusion 1.1.1

VMware Fusion 1.1.1 is a maintenance release that contains fixes for a variety of issues.

VMware Fusion now transparently remaps keyboard shortcuts when the user goes back and forth between applications in the guest and in the host. For example, VMware Fusion remaps -X to Ctrl-X in the guest. The same remapping happens for -Z/-C/-V/-P/-A/-F.
The number pad Enter key on European keyboards is always treated as AltGr. NumLock no longer disables this feature.
This release fixes host and guest connectivity problems that could arise when using wireless networking.
VMware Fusion 1.1 contained a fix so that suspending a virtual machine located in a FileVault folder no longer makes the system unresponsive. The problem reappeared with Mac OS X 10.5.x (Leopard), and this release fixes it in this version of the OS as well.
Print jobs sent from the guest to a Kodak AiO 5100 series printer are now successful.
When the user starts up a Boot Camp virtual machine, the password prompt now has focus, so that the user can type in the password without first having to move the mouse over the dialog box to select it.
A problem causing the application to hang at launch, and for which the workaround was to delete the plist, has been fixed in this release.
In some instances users with Mac OS X 10.5.0 and 10.5.1 could get a soreceive corrupted . . . kernel panic. Version 1.1.1 fixes this problem.
Version 1.1.1 corrects a problem in which VMware Fusion was producing an error message when a user attempted to enable promiscuous mode for an Ethernet adapter in Mac OS X 10.5.
The SRS iWOW plugin no longer breaks the sound in VMware Fusion.
This release fixes a problem with the internal microphone when VMware Fusion runs on Mac OS X 10.5.
Version 1.1.1 corrects a caps lock LED synchronization problem that could lead to a kernel panic in vmioplug.
This release fixes problems with using the mouse after installing VMware Tools on a Ubuntu 7.10 guest.
This release fixes a problem that resulted in a hang when certain volumes were accessed from an HGFS share.
Having a Digidesign CoreAudio plugin no longer causes a bouncing vmx icon to appear in the Dock with a "Not Responding" label in Activity Monitor.
In some cases, a VMware virtual machine would not recognize a hardware breakpoint set in an application and would not stop the code execution. This problem has been fixed.
Some Mac OS X bugs affect VMware Fusion 1.1.1.

As a workaround for Apple bug 5679432 (Mac OS X hang under heavy disk load when unbuffered I/O is in use), VMware Fusion 1.1.1 disables unbuffered disk I/O on Mac OS X 10.5 hosts, even when the user selects Optimize for Mac OS application performance in VMware Fusion preferences.
A bug in the operating system would, in some cases, result in all applications running with root privileges following a upgrade to Mac OS X 10.5.1, instead of how the user originally set them. This would prevent VMware Fusion from reading its own files. This has been reported to Apple to be addressed in a future release.

VMware Fusion 1.1 includes the following improvements and bug fixes:

Intel VT is now correctly enabled on 64-bit Intel Macs when powering on or resuming a virtual machine after the Mac is put to sleep or awakened
Fixed issue where VMware Fusion would use more memory over time
Resolved issue where windows would freeze in certain cases in Unity view
Improved DNS resolution when using NAT networking
Fixed issue where Caps Lock mapping preference would always be reset after using VMware Fusion 1.1 Beta
Restored ability to shrink virtual disks lost after using VMware Fusion 1.1 Beta
In addition to the improvements listed above, this release fixes numerous bugs to greatly improve the stability of VMware Fusion.

Gaming with VMware Fusion

VMware Fusion now has experimental support for DirectX 9.0 3-D graphics (without shader support) to enable more Microsoft Windows 3-D applications and games to run. This will allow for many new games to run in VMware Fusion that could not be previously run. However, if a game requires shaders it may not run at all. Games that provide the ability to run without shaders can potentially run in VMware Fusion 1.1.

VMware Fusion does not support 3-D acceleration in Unity view. For 3-D applications, use Single Window or Full Screen view.

Customizing the virtual machine's mouse settings for playing games 
Most games require some custom mouse settings to work correctly. These settings lock the mouse to the virtual machine when you are running a game. Note: These settings will affect the acceleration setting of the mouse, and disable the ability to automatically move the mouse between the virtual machine and your Mac. The setting in the user's preference file will also prevent the use of the drag-and-drop feature from all virtual machines to the host machine. Remove the settings to revert back to default behavior.

To customize the virtual machine's mouse settings for playing games, use TextEdit to make the following changes while the virtual machine is powered off:

In the virtual machine directory, add the following line to the end of the virtual machine's configuration (.vmx) file:
vmmouse.present = "FALSE"
In your home directory, add the following line to the end of the file ~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/preferences:
pref.motionUngrab = "FALSE"
These configuration settings do not take effect until you shut down the virtual machine, quit VMware Fusion, and then restart VMware Fusion and the virtual machine.

Note: The configuration file setting vmmouse.present = "FALSE" and the preference file setting pref.motionUngrab = "FALSE" are incompatible with Unity view. To use Unity view, change the configuration file settings for vmmouse.present and pref.motionUngrab to "TRUE" or delete the lines from the configuration file.
Also Note: When you edit a virtual machine's configuration (.vmx) file, if you copy and paste text from a browser into the file using TextEdit, VMware Fusion might be unable to open the resulting .vmx file, because some applications (like Firefox) add legacy Mac characters (carriage returns) at the end of each line. This release of VMware Fusion requires Mac OS X characters (line feeds) at the end of each line, and cannot understand legacy Mac characters. To work around this problem, convert the legacy end-of-line characters in the .vmx file to Mac OS X end-of-line characters:

Open Terminal from /Applications/Utilities.
Type
nano "~/Virtual Machines/vm-dir/vm-name.vmx" 
where vm-dir and vm-name are the path and name of your .vmx file, and press Enter.
When nano loads, type Control-O, and press Enter. This converts the legacy end-of-line characters to Mac OS X end-of-line characters.
Type Control-X to exit.

Before You Begin

Install antivirus software in Windows virtual machines before you connect networking.
Connecting a Windows virtual machine to a network exposes the virtual machine to any active viruses present in the network. VMware recommends that you install antivirus software in any Windows virtual machine before you connect networking. Note that VMware Fusion's default network connection type for new virtual machines is NAT, which will prevent the spread of viruses over the network into the virtual machine, and will only expose the virtual machine to external viruses through browser security flaws when you browse the Internet.

Tips and Tricks

Tips on using the Mac keyboard
If you are unfamiliar with Mac keyboards, the following tips will help you send keystrokes that you know from PC keyboards to virtual machines:

To send the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keystroke combination to a virtual machine, do one of the following:
From the Virtual Machine menu, select Send Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
If you are using an external PC keyboard, press Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
On a full-sized Mac keyboard, press Control-Option-. The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.
On a Mac laptop keyboard, press Fn-Ctrl-Option-Delete.
The delete key on Apple keyboards is actually the backspace key to all other operating systems. To send the Del key to a virtual machine:
On a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-Delete.
On a full-sized Mac keyboard, press . The  (Forward Delete) key is below the Help key.
Mac keyboards do not have an obvious Insert key. To send the Insert key to a virtual machine:
On a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard, press Fn-M.
On a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the Help key.
Mac keyboards do not have a PRINT SCREEN key. To send the PRINT SCREEN key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press F13.

U.S. Mac keyboards do not have an AltGr key. To send the AltGr key to a virtual machine, on a full-sized Mac keyboard, press the right Option key.
AltGr is supported on European MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards. The Enter key next to the right Command key (otherwise known as the numeric pad Enter key) is remapped to AltGr on Mac laptops.
Using Unity view

Unity view works only after you install the latest version of VMware Tools in the virtual machine and reboot. 
For this version of VMware Fusion, if you do not reboot the virtual machine after installing VMware Tools, the Applications menu might not be populated.

Note the following known issues with VMware Fusion support of Unity view in Microsoft Windows Vista virtual machines:

The Start button always appears in the bottom left corners of the main monitor.
The Windows background shows through the Windows Sidebar. For the best experience, VMware recommends that you disable the Windows Sidebar when you use Unity view.
Known Issues with VMware Fusion

For networking to work properly in your virtual machines, reboot your Mac after upgrading its operating system, or after using the Migration Assistant.
After upgrading from Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) to Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), you must to reboot your Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion. Similarly, after using Apple's Migration Assistant to move your data and applications from one Mac to another, you will need to reboot the new Mac for networking to work properly in virtual machines running under VMware Fusion.


Unity view in VMware Fusion can disrupt the operation of Spaces virtual desktops in Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).
If you are running VMware Fusion in Unity view in one space but working in another space, the appearance of a popup window (for instance, an Outlook calendar event reminder) in the VMware Fusion virtual machine can cause Spaces to jump back and forth between the two virtual desktops.


Conflict in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) between VMware Fusion and anti-virus software can cause memory corruption.
Running a virtual machine in VMware Fusion creates a .vmem file either inside the virtual machine's package, or in /tmp/vmware-. If you are running Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger), and the Norton AntiVirus' Auto-Protect feature scans the .vmem file while the virtual machine is running, host memory corruption can occur. The problem described here has been reproduced with Norton AntiVirus, but it is possible that the problem could occur with other anti-virus or backup software as well.

Upgrade to Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) to avoid this problem altogether.

To prevent this conflict from occurring in Mac OS X 10.4, exclude both the Virtual Machines folder and the /tmp/vmware-<YourUserName> folder from the Norton AntiVirus SafeZones (System Preferences > Norton Auto-Protect > Safe Zones > Everywhere EXCEPT in).

A typical symptom of this problem is that when you try to suspend the virtual machine, it gets stuck, and VMware Fusion can no longer run virtual machines. To recover from that situation:
Shut down the host operating system as soon as possible and restart it.
Prevent the conflict from occurring as described above.
Discard the .vmss file for the affected virtual machine. Note: Whatever state was saved in the last suspend is lost.
Boot up the virtual machine.

Microsoft Windows sometimes fails when you attempt to run the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.
In some cases, attempting to run your Boot Camp partition as a VMware Fusion virtual machine might result in Windows failing. If this happens, editing the Boot Camp virtual machine .vmx file might possibly fix the problem. One thing to try is to open the .vmx file and delete the line that reads
scsi0.present = "TRUE".

To find the .vmx file for the Boot Camp virtual machine, go to the virtual machine's package at
<your home folder>/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp/<disk identifier>/Boot Camp partition.vmwarevm.
Right-click on the package, choose Show Package Contents, and open the .vmx file shown in the package.


Every time the virtual machine tries to play a sound it gets the error "Cannot connect virtual device sound"
In rare instances with certain virtual machines originally created with a product other than Fusion, the virtual machine gets this error and is unable to play sound each time it powers on and each time it tries to play a sound. To work around this problem, power off the virtual machine, remove the sound device by going to Settings and clicking the Remove Sound Device button in the Sound pane, and re-add it by clicking the button (now labeled Add Sound Device) again.


Some Applications menu items do not work if VMware Tools has not been updated.
If you run a Microsoft Windows virtual machine in VMware Fusion 1.1 with VMware Tools installed from version 1.0, the Applications menu items My Computer, My Documents, My Network Places, Control Panel, and Run do not work. Upgrade VMware Tools to fix this problem.


Easy Install of a Vista guest operating system fails if the user name on the Mac is Administrator.
If you create a virtual machine in this manner, it cannot be logged into because it acts as if no valid user was created. Trying to log in as administrator results in a message saying the account has been disabled.
To avoid this problem when you create a virtual machine: in the Windows Easy Install panel of the New Virtual Machine Assistant, change the entry in the Name field from the default entry Administrator. 

If you have already created the virtual machine with Administrator entered in the Name field on the Windows Easy Install panel, take the following steps to work around the problem:
Start the virtual machine in safe mode by pressing F8 during the boot.
Once the virtual machine is booted in safe mode, Vista permits you to log on to the system as administrator, which it does not permit in non-safe mode.
In start > run type manage.
Expand the local users and groups area, and select users.
Select administrator in the right pane.
Choose action > properties.
Deselect Disable this account in the General tab.

Cannot select anything on the guest desktop with the mouse when in Unity view if you select Show the Desktop from the Taskbar.
To recover from this problem, do one of the following:
Select any of the Unity windows, which are minimized to the dock in this situation.
Use Alt-Tab to select a window in the guest.
Use the Applications menu to launch an application.


Changes to the shared folder settings might not take effect.
When you make changes in the settings window to the Shared Folders window, sometimes the changes will not take effect. To ensure that the changes you make actually happen, use the Apply button rather then the OK button. If the changes you made did not properly take effect, please repeat them and click Apply.
Note: The check box that indicates the shared folders feature is enabled can only become enabled when the virtual machine is powered on. The enabled check box to permit access to a specific shared folder can be enabled and disabled at any time.


No audio can be heard in virtual machines created with some very old guest operating systems.
Old operating systems, such as DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95, may not have drivers for the virtual ES1371 sound device that Fusion presents. Other VMware products optionally present a Sound Blaster 16 device for these guests, but Fusion does not have this capability. This clarification also applies to previous versions of VMware Fusion.


The Mac stops responding or experiences a kernel panic if you run two virtual machines on a RAID 0 disk.
RAID 0 volumes are not a tested configuration for VMware Fusion 1.1. Work is in progress on this problem.


Installing VMware Tools in Fusion for a virtual machine created in Japanese Workstation 6 might cause the installer to fail.
In Fusion, if you open a virtual machine created in Japanese Workstation 6 and try to install VMware Tools, the installation might fail with an error message.
Workaround: Uninstall the tools from within the virtual machine and then install the Fusion 1.1 tools.
Open the virtual machine.
Choose Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools to display the VMware Tools wizard.
Select Remove, and click Next and Remove.
Choose Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools to go to the VMware Tools wizard and install a fresh version of VMware Tools.

In new virtual machines, the VMware Shared Folders shortcut is not created on certain French or Japanese Windows desktops.
Ordinarily, when creating a new virtual machine, VMware Fusion creates a shared folders shortcut on the guest operating system desktop. However, in the case of virtual machines created with French or Japanese Microsoft Windows XP Pro SP2 as the guest operating system, this does not occur.
Workaround: Create your own shortcut.
Open the Explorer.
Type \\.host in the Address field.
Press Enter.
Right-click on the Shared Folders icon.
Choose Create a Shortcut.
Click Yes to the message Windows cannot create a shortcut here. Do you want the shortcut to be placed on the desktop instead?
A shortcut to Shared Folders is now available to the user on the French or Japanese Windows XP virtual machine.


Creating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 might fail if there is insufficient memory.
Before creating a new virtual machine with Solaris 10 as its guest operating system, ensure that you have enough memory assigned to the virtual machine to complete the process. You need 490MB and an additional 50MB for each NIC. For instance, if you were creating a virtual machine with two NICs, you would need to assign a minimum of 590MB to have a successful virtual machine creation.


Turbolinux 10 Server does not reboot automatically after installation in a virtual machine.
At the end of the installation of Turbolinux 10 Server in a virtual machine, when you click Finish the system does not reboot and the screen becomes black. This results from a problem Turbolinux has switching from X to VGA. Workaround: Press the Enter key to continue with the reboot.


After upgrading to VMware Fusion 1.1, 3-D works only after you install the latest version of VMware Tools in the virtual machine and reboot.
If you do not install the latest version of VMware Tools, which updates the SVGA driver, 3-D will not work in the virtual machine. To get 3-D to work, go to the Virtual Machine menu and choose Install VMware Tools. Reboot the virtual machine.
Note: This also applies when reverting to a snapshot taken from an earlier version of VMware Fusion before the upgrade to version 1.1. 3-D will not work, and you must update VMware Tools and reboot the virtual machine.


Using the Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine can, in a few rare instances, result in a 07B failure when the virtual machine is booted.
If this happens, boot into Boot Camp natively, immediately hold down F8 and select boot into last known good state. This will restore the functionality of your Boot Camp partition only in native mode.
To help VMware better understand what happens in this case, please file a support incident that includes your Boot Camp logs. The logs can be found in your home folder as the file
~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Helper/naos-1.0.vmwarevm/vmware.log
Please note that the folder naos-1.0.vmwarevm is a package. If you are opening it with Finder, right-click the icon and select Show Package Contents.


When you use the Mac dock to launch an application from a powered-off virtual machine, VMware Fusion does not always successfully restore the virtual machine to Unity view.
In this situation, the dock can incorrectly indicate that an application is running, even though the virtual machine is in Single Window view. After you power off the virtual machine, the dock continues to incorrectly show that the application is running. To work around this problem, Control-click or right-click the application icon in the dock, and select Quit. This problem has been observed frequently on Mac Minis, and less frequently on Macbook Pros.


Changing the host Mac resolution while a virtual machine is in Unity view causes mouse and display problems. 
In virtual machines running in Unity view, if you change the host Mac to a display resolution higher or lower than the resolution of the virtual machine, the mouse can become inoperable or the display can become corrupted. To avoid this problem, do not change the host Mac resolution while a virtual machine is in Unity view.


Plugging in or unplugging an external display while a virtual machine is in Unity view causes display problems. 
In virtual machines running in Unity view, if you plug in or unplug an external display, the display can become corrupted and cause the Unity windows to disappear. To avoid this problem, do not plug in or unplug an external display while a virtual machine is in Unity view.


On dual-monitor host systems, when you switch from Unity view to Full Screen view, virtual machines displayed on the secondary monitor do not have the correct screen resolution.
To work around this problem, switch to Single Window view, and then switch to Full Screen view.


When you copy or move a virtual machine to a new location, the virtual machine does not retain information from the original virtual machine about applications displayed in the Mac dock in Unity view. 
To work around this problem, delete the Applications folder from the copied or moved virtual machine:
Power off the virtual machine.
Control-click or right-click the virtual machine in the Finder and select Show Package Contents.
Locate the Applications folder, move this folder to the Trash, and empty the Trash.
Power on the virtual machine.

Some file systems, such as FAT and UFS, are unable to support very large files. 
If you are creating a virtual machine that will be used in a hard drive with a file system that does not support very large files, select the New Virtual Machine Assistant option Split disk into 2GB files. This option is in Advanced disk options, in the Virtual Hard Disk panel of the New Virtual Machine Assistant.


Applications that use Multiple Document Interface (MDI), such as Microsoft Excel, might not display correctly in Unity view.


In Unity view, VMware Fusion does not support multiple monitors. 
All virtual machine windows displayed in Unity view must be in a single-monitor display.


When a virtual machine application is displayed in Unity view, quitting the application from the Mac dock does not work. 
For this release, in Unity view, when you Control-click or right-click a virtual machine application in the dock and select Quit, the application icon is removed from the dock, but the application itself continues to run.


Unity view is not supported when more than one user is logged in to Windows. 
Fast User Switching is not compatible with Unity view.


In Windows virtual machines, if you uninstall the VMware pointing device driver, and then Control-click or right-click to select an option from an application displayed in Unity view, the virtual machine might quit unexpectedly.
This problem can occur if you uninstall the VMware pointing device in My Computer > Properties > Hardware > Device Manager, and then, in a virtual machine application window displayed in Unity view, Control-click or right-click and select any option, for example, Properties.


Switching to Unity view while a snapshot operation is in progress may result in unpredictable display behavior.
Do not switch views while a snapshot operation is in progress. To recover from this situation, switch to Single Window view and then back to Unity view.


When you cancel a drag-and-drop operation between the Mac host and a virtual machine, it may take several seconds before another drag-and-drop operation is possible. 
The virtual machine guest operating system can require several seconds to cancel a drag-and-drop operation. When you attempt a drag-and-drop operation, a plus sign (+) should appear on the file or folder you are dragging and dropping. If the plus sign does not appear, the virtual machine could be processing a prior operation. Wait a few seconds and try again.


In rare circumstances, a virtual machine can fail to detect any bootable CD in the CD/DVD drive, including the Windows XP installation CD.
To work around this problem, try the following:
In the virtual machine, open Virtual Machine > Settings > Removable Devices > CD/DVD.
Change the setting from Automatically detect physical CD/DVD drive to Specify physical CD/DVD drive, and select cdrom0.
Click OK.

If the antivirus software Alwil avast! 4.7 is installed in a virtual machine, when you access VMware Fusion shared folders through a Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path (rather than through a mapped drive letter) it can cause Windows Explorer to become unresponsive or quit unexpectedly. 
To work around this problem, access VMware Fusion Shared Folders through a mapped drive letter and not through a UNC path. You could also use a different antivirus program: this problem has not been observed with other antivirus programs.


If the antivirus software Alwil avast! 4.7 is installed in a virtual machine, the virtual machine might become unresponsive when you open a document from a VMware Fusion Shared Folder with permissions set to read/write. 
To work around this problem, move the document from the VMware Fusion Shared Folder to a local folder in the virtual machine. You could also use a different antivirus program: this problem has not been observed with other antivirus programs.


If the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file contains the line monitor = "debug", deselecting the option Diagnostics: Enable debugging checks has no effect.
To work around this problem, open the virtual machine configuration file in a text editor and remove the line monitor = "debug".


Files in DivX digital media format versions higher than 6.3 do not display correctly in Windows Media Player in VMware Fusion virtual machines. 
To work around this problem:
With Windows Media Player open, click the down-facing triangle in the upper right of the Windows Media Player window to display the applications menus, and choose Tools > Options.
In the Options window, select the Performance tab, and click Advanced.
Deselect the option Use video mixing renderer.

Powering on a virtual machine within a host window that has a scrollbar might cause the virtual machine to respond to mouse input incorrectly or incompletely.
To work around this problem, click the host window's scrollbar to scroll the display up or down.


In virtual machines running Linux distributions with kernel versions lower than 2.4, VMware Fusion does not support drag and drop operations between the virtual machine and the host.


The VMware Fusion BIOS posts too quickly to access. 
Most users will not need to access the BIOS, but advanced users might want to do so, to change the boot order, set a boot password, or enable a second floppy drive. To work around this problem, use a text editor to add the following line to the configuration (.vmx) file of the virtual machine:
bios.forceSetupOnce = "TRUE"
The next time you boot up the virtual machine, it will automatically boot into the BIOS. This configuration option then reverts to FALSE. You must set the option to TRUE each time you want to boot the virtual machine into the BIOS.


If you are installing Microsoft Windows Vista from multiple installation disks, Windows Easy Install does not work.
To install Vista from multiple installation disks, use the standard installation: in the New Virtual Machine Assistant, when the Windows Easy Install panel is displayed, deselect Use Easy Install and click Continue to proceed with the standard installation.


In virtual machines running on Macs with two monitors, each with its own video card, if you run a 3-D application with 3-D acceleration enabled, VMware Fusion fails with an ASSERT.
VMware Fusion does not support 3-D acceleration for this configuration. If your Mac has two monitors, each with its own video card, do not enable 3-D acceleration.


Powering on multiple virtual machines (whose combined memory allocation exceeds that of the host physical system) can slow the system.
If the memory allocated to running virtual machines approaches or exceeds the physical memory available on the host, the system can become very slow. This can happen with one or more virtual machines running. Make sure to only power on virtual machines that have memory allocations that your host machine can handle. If you encounter this problem, close one or more virtual machines. You might also consider reducing the memory allocation of some of your virtual machines (Virtual Machine > Settings > System Hardware > Memory).


Using iSight in Mac OS X versions lower than 10.4.8 after using it in a virtual machine might require shutting down and restarting the host machine.
VMware Fusion does not support Mac OS X versions lower than 10.4.8. After disconnecting the built-in iSight camera from a Windows XP virtual machine, you might experience issues with corrupted video when using the camera in Mac OS X versions 10.4.7 and lower.

If this occurs, shut down your host machine and turn it back on to reset your iSight camera. Rebooting is not sufficient to completely reset the iSight camera. To avoid this problem, upgrade your Mac OS X system software to version 10.4.9 or higher.


On Macs with more than one CD-ROM drive (internal or external), physical CD-ROM drives cannot be moved between running virtual machines.
This occurs when two or more virtual machines are powered on, and one of the physical CD-ROM drive is connected to one of the powered-on virtual machines. If you disconnect the physical CD-ROM drive from the virtual machine, and then attempt to connect the CD-ROM drive to one of the other powered-on virtual machines, the connection fails.

To work around this problem, reset the virtual machines.


Guests with extremely high display resolutions (2360 x 1770) may display as a solid white screen.
This issue might occur with a Mac mini or Macbook. To work around this problem, set the display in the guest to a lower resolution.


Virtual machines stored on drives formatted with FAT32 may crash in VMware Fusion.
This problem is accompanied by the error message: Argument list too long.
Testing suggests that this problem may indicate a corrupted disk.


Migrating Linux virtual machines between Intel and AMD hosts. 
VMware recommends you do not migrate a Linux virtual machine between hosts when one host is running on an AMD processor and the other is running on an Intel processor.

During installation, many distributions of Linux choose a kernel that is optimized for the specific processor on which it is being installed, and some distributions install a generic kernel by default, but provide architecture-specific kernels that the user can choose to install. The kernel might contain instructions that are available only on that processor. These instructions can have adverse effects when run on a host with the wrong type of processor.


For 64-bit SUSE Linux versions lower than 10.1, VMware virtual machines support the X graphical windows system only if you have installed VMware Tools in the virtual machine.


Fixing sound problems in virtual machines running Vista 32-bit edition 
When you install Microsoft Vista 32-bit edition in a VMware Fusion virtual machine, there is no sound output. To correct this problem, run Windows Update to update the sound driver from within Vista. 

To update the sound driver in a VMware Fusion virtual machine running Windows Vista 32-bit edition:
In the virtual machine, from the Windows start menu, right-click Computer and select Properties.
In the left pane, under Tasks, select Device Manager.
When prompted for your permission to continue, click Continue.
Windows displays the Device Manager.
Right-click the Multimedia Sound Adapter with a warning symbol (indicating that there is no driver) and select Update Driver Software.
At the prompt How do you want to search for driver software?, select Search automatically for updated driver software. 
Windows finds and installs the appropriate driver for your virtual sound card.
When you are prompted to restart, click Restart Now.
Sound should now work in your Microsoft Vista 32-bit virtual machine.

Sound does not work in virtual machines running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2. 
To enable sound in a virtual machine running Windows 2003 Server 64-bit Enterprise Edition R2, you must enable the Windows Audio Service: open the Sounds and Audio Devices Control Panel. Windows prompts you to enable the audio device. When you enable the device, Windows reboots. Sound should now work in the virtual machine.
