ChoiceMail v5.104
Release Notes - these notes describe changes that apply to ChoiceMail Desktop v5.104

Bug fixes
Smart Message Forwarding Address Cannot be removed - In ChoiceMail v5.x we introduced a feature where you can forward your good mail to a list of addresses. It seems that under some circumstances you could not later remove those addresses completely from the list. This has been fixed in version 5.104

Release notes file shipped with previous version (5.103) which is accessible directly from ChoiceMail was not updated properly. Now the file is correctly updated.


January 15th, 2009. Version 5.103
January 15th, 2009
ChoiceMail v5.103
Release Notes - these notes describe changes that apply to ChoiceMail One v5.103

New Features
Smart Message Forwarding  - ChoiceMail v5.x can now easily forward your ChoiceMail cleaned mail to your online account. This means that you can now safely get your spam-free mail on your BlackBerry, iPhone or other small device or anywhere where you have a web browser access. The message forwarding that we built into ChoiceMail works differently than message forwarding in your email application. When ChoiceMail forwards a message - you will see the original sender as the sender of the message and if you reply - the reply will go to the correct address of the original sender. Regular message forwarding breaks these rules and forwards messages from you so replying from your phone is actually replying to yourself which is most likely not what you want. Our users requested this feature - we listened!
Click here to read how to set this up in three easy steps! 


Whitelist Exporting built in. ChoiceMail v5.x now has the ability to export your whitelist form the ChoiceMail Admin Control Panel. Just click on User Management, select your username and click the export button. You can backup this file or use it when you move ChoiceMail to a new system. To import your whitelist back - simply select Actions->Import in your ChoiceMail and select the file you exported to.


Built in web server . ChoiceMail v5.x contains its own small, but safe web server. This means that you can now access your ChoiceMail using a web browser from anywhere in the house. Anything you could do with your ChoiceMail application can now be done using a web browser. You can also access your ChoiceMail from outside your house provided you have a way to access your computer and set up your firewall/router properly.


New skin support. ChoiceMail now support several different skins (including the previous version one). This way you can change the look of your ChoiceMail application with a click of a button. Just look under the "Display" menu.



February 7th, 2008. Version 4.501
February 7th, 2008
ChoiceMail One 4.501
Release Notes - these notes describe changes that apply to ChoiceMail One v4.501

Updates
Registration system overhaul - The internal sender registration and verification system has undergone a major change to allow for more scalability and complience with new technologies like SPF (Sender Policy Framework).
Updated the pre-approval library - the internal pre-approval library responsible for listening for outbound messages has been updated to include some performance improvements and bug fixes.


Database optimizations - Internal ChoiceMail database has been improved to offer better performance with large sender lists.
Internal timeouts increased - The internal timeouts between the ChoiceMail front end and the back end has been slightly increased to account for slower systems with large amounts of data.

Bug Fixes
Fixed typo on the notification window - There was a typo in the popup notification window when it was displaying the error about server sonnection.
Fixed summary popup option - Fixed the problem where users were not able to permanently switch off the summary panel on the main window.

August 16th, 2007
ChoiceMail One 4.203
Release Notes - these notes describe changes that apply to ChoiceMail One v4.203

New Features

Full Windows Vista compatibility - ChoiceMail One v4.2 is now fully Vista compatible. Main components run as a service in the background and allow several users to use ChoiceMail (if license allows it).


Search/Filter functionality extended - Many users asked for the ability to sort unknown senders by recipient or search through by words present in the subject body. ChoiceMail v4.2 includes support for both.


Leave mail on server - It is now possible to leave mail on your ISP server for certain amount of time. This feature should only be used with ONE ChoiceMail installation or you may end up sending duplicate challenge messages as well as creating inconsistencies in your mailbox.


Support for Windows Mail - ChoiceMail One v4.2 can now recognize Windows Mail accounts and automatically configure them to be used with ChoiceMail.


Runs in background - ChoiceMail One v4.2 is comprised of two components now. The main processing component (CMServer.exe) will run in the background even if the ChoiceMail window is closed or users are logged off. This ensures timely identity verification processing for all users as well as lower memory usage.


Multi User Support - If license allows it - ChoiceMail can now support multiple users on a single computer. Users will have separate settings and be able to define their email addresses separately.


Updates

Better SMTP handling - It is not mandatory to change your outgoing (SMTP) server settings in your email application for Choice Mail's pre-approval feature to work. The new setup wizard will keep your original settings. This solves the problem where messages from different accounts must be sent using different outgoing servers or settings.


New look and feel - New user interface. Hopefully we managed to give ChoiceMail pleasing look as well as more functional interface.


Help system - New, searchable help system is much easier to use and find relevant information.


General operation - ChoiceMail's general operation has been improved and optimized.


WebMail Gateway - For users of ChoiceMail 3.x - please note that webmail gateway that was included in some previous versions of ChoiceMail is no longer supporter or distributed by DigiPortal Software. Alternative options are availabe though. Some are described in a knowledge base article please click here to read the article.


Bug Fixes

Email processing - Fixed a problem where combination of certain messages and permission rules could result in incorrect rules and mailbox processing.


Updater on Vista issue - Fixed a problem where our updater component continually triggered Windows Vista security verifications.


Registration popup disappears - Fixed a problem where in some cases registration popup window would disappear immediately after the popup.


Reject Sender with Explanation feature - This feature was not working in some instances. Fixed in this release.


Coach.exe taking 100% CPU - this was a rare problem on some systems. Coach.exe is not used in this version of ChoiceMail which fixes the issue

Release Notes - these notes describe features that apply to all versions of ChoiceMail except where indicated

It's extremely convenient for those quick and dirty emails you need to send out without the bother of starting up your heavyweight email program.
Virtual email addresses (ChoiceMail One only) ¡ª ChoiceMail One now supports the ability to manage more than 5 virtual email addresses. (You can now purchase additional virtual email addresses in blocks of 50 to use with ChoiceMail One)
Web browser (ChoiceMail Enterprise / ChoiceMail Small Business) ¡ª Completely new web browser interface ¨C easier and more efficient navigation.
Web Browser interface (ChoiceMail Small Business/ChoiceMail Enterprise)¡ª Ability to download attachments directly from the web browser

Virtual addresses¡ª Virtual addresses are now displayed in sorted order in the online virtual address dialog manager.
Virtual addresses¡ª Virtual addresses are now displayed in sorted order in the system tray icon menu. You can also invoke the virtual address dialog manager directly from the system tray.
Interacting with other spam blockers (ChoiceMail Enterprise)¡ª Handle a situation where badly implemented (or misconfigured) spam blockers block ChoiceMail Enterprise from sending emails because ChoiceMail Enterprise (correctly) fails the (incorrectly implemented) attempts of the other spam blocker to validate the legitimacy of the sending domain (sigh).
Server disconnection¡ª Some POP3 servers disconnect automatically if there¡¯s a long delay without any activity. Added the ability to send periodic signals to the server to let it know that we¡¯re still alive!
Activity logs and feedback¡ª When copying the activity logs to the clipboard for submission to our online ticket system, basic ChoiceMail configuration is also included to make it easier to diagnose the problem.
Permission rules¡ª Added (empty) function to test if subject or body is empty
Process control (ChoiceMail Enterprise)¡ª More ability to prevent ChoiceMail Enterprise from being inappropriately overloaded.

Web Browser interface (ChoiceMail Enterprise/ChoiceMail Small Business)¨D Fixed a bug where certain characters entered into the filter text field could screw up an SQL query

Web Browser interface (ChoiceMail Enterprise/ChoiceMail Small Business)¨D Fixed a bug where the filter field could not always be cleared.

Memory leaks¡ª Found and squashed a few exotic leaks!
Domain Address Editor¡ª Fixed a problem where it looked like IP address ranges were disappearing when a new one was added. Also fixed a problem where an invalid range in a region caused the total list to increase each time regions were merged.

Approve/Reject multiple domains- You can now approve or reject multiple domains by selecting the senders whose domains you wish to approve or reject.

Fixes

Deleting messages in junkbox (CMSB Server only)- We no longer open sequential TCP/IP connections to delete non-contiguous messages from the junkbox. This allows individually selected messages to be deleted much more quickly.
Aliases- Fixed problem where after deleting a user account - alias cache was not refreshed.
Junk box column sizes- You can now make the column sizes really small if you don't need to see particular columns.
Memory leak- Fixed a very obscure memory leak that was slowly wasting filehandle resources

Web interface (ChoiceMail Enterprise and CMSB only)- Fixed a problem where an occasional access violation could prevent remote logins.

Permission rules- Fixed problems with OtherHeaders condition. Also now remove trailing colon if someone puts it in by mistake when entering an other header.
Outlook Express identities- Fixed a problem where the setup wizard could not always determine from which identity to retrieve email addresses.
Infinite looping (ChoiceMail Enterprise only)- Fixed potential problem where email could get into an infinite loop if mail server was configured to relay all mail through ChoiceMail, generate non delivery reports and spammer used the from address that matches one of CME domains.



April 27th, 2004. Version 2.5
April 27th, 2004
ChoiceMail 2.5
Release Notes


New features
Detect spam by servers in message- Added the ability to find and resolve to IP addresses all servers referenced in the body of a message. Along with a new transform rule function, this allows messages to be deleted based on IP address ranges.
Permission rules- When a message is matched by a permission rule, that rule can cause an email message to be sent back to the sender.
Drag/drop email addresses- Email addresses can now be dragged from compliant email applications into the approved or rejected sender view
Drag/drop email address files¡ª If you have a file containing email addresses, you can drag that file into the approved or rejected sender view to whitelist or blacklist them respectively. Multiple files can be dragged in one operation.
Permission rules- Two new permission functions allow domains and IP addresses to be checked against a sequence of IP address ranges.
Database support- ChoiceMail One now uses a SQL database instead of INI files for most information. The initial main benefit for ChoiceMail One single users will be greatly reduced memory requirements.
System rules (CM Enterprise only)- Added support for global permission rules that can be applied centrally before individual user rules are applied.
Tip of the day- Added automatic tip of the day support

Updates

Servers referenced in message- Added ability to see the list of all servers referenced in a message, complete with their IP addresses
Transform rules- Transform rules now work for headers as well as subject and body. It's also possible to have a single transform rule work for multiple items.
Transform rules- The transform rules are now displayed in tree format rather than as a raw text file.
Downloading emails- Added functionality to prevent ChoiceMail from downloading previously downloaded mails when an external error closes the TCP/IP connection.
Preview from approval dialog- Added the ability to preview messages from the "new sender registration" popup
Email rules dialog- Added the ability to move the rules with the mouse
Junk box- Added a TO field in the junk box
Support for legacy Eudora- Support commands that can be generated by Eudora users who have (or used to have) very old versions of Eudora
Splash screen- The splash screen can now be disabled by modifying the choicemail.ini file (unsupported)
Received Header (CM Enterprise)- CM Enterprise now has the option to insert its own received header into a message.
Permission management- A new action is now available that lets you mark an item as SPAM but leaves it in your unknown senders list and does not send a challenge. This is useful when playing with rules to see which items are affected by a rule. The color of the SPAM icon is different from regular unknown sender icons so as to stand out.
Permission management- The BCC icon is now displayed in a different color to make it stand out better from regular unknown senders.
Permission management- A new tab has been added that allows you to match attachment filenames. Attachment filenames can now be seen in the message previewer.
Permission management- The MoveUp and MoveDown buttons can be held down to make rule positions move quickly.
Permission management- Redesigned the permission rule dialog so that it fits better on smaller resolution screens
Permission management- Negating a rule now requires the initial 'not' to be enclosed in parenthesis.
IMAP- Added ability to disable IMAP proxy.
Activity logs- The maximum size of the activity logs can be changed by modifying a section in the popmanager.ini file (not officially supported)
Blocking mail servers- It is now possible to select text in the headers of a message (in the message previewer window) and create (or modify) a permission rule that will block all future messages coming from that mail server.
Permission rules- Permission rules created by users are displayed in blue while DigiPortal Software provided rules are displayed in black. Future versions of ChoiceMail One may change the behavior of (or silently remove) any permission rule that was provided by DigiPortal Software - therefore, changing permission rules provided by DigiPortal is not a good idea. Instead, disable them if you don't want them and create your own modified rules.

Fixes

Corrupted decode- Addressed an issue where a binary attachment was deliberately corrupted to cause normal decoding to fail and this caused permission management to fail with a range-check error.
Setup wizard- We had a problem where an old server configuration file where SMTP settings were already in there, but none of the other settings were defined. This was causing List Out Of Bounds errors.
Eudora- Fixed a problem where importing multiple personalities could cause an access violation.
Passwords- Fixed problem where user password could be corrupt due to some unpredictable file copy operations.
Login- Fixed problem where real mailbox and virtual mailboxes could be logged in at the same time.
Registration- Fixed a problem where pasting in a received usercode and registration key did not enable the OK button. The person responsible for this bug has been slain
Permission rules- A couple of regular expressions had erroneous OR characters in them.
Housekeeping- Email cleaner now runs every hour instead of every minute - also removes old registration files properly
Locking- Fixed incorrect functionality : CM shouldn't start up minimized if it's locked
IMAP- Re-introduced ChoiceMail IMAP initialization when an IMAP source gets tested

Long delay - Fixed a problem where ChoiceMail could be held up for a long time by an incoming attachment that contains no regular text.
Junk box - We no longer populate the junkbox when CM starts ¨C this prevents CM from hogging CPU cycles for long periods of time at start up.

September 9th, 2003. Version 2.000
September 9th, 2003
ChoiceMail 2.000
Release Notes


New Features

Multiple identities  - ChoiceMail now lets your multiple email accounts retrieve only those messages intended for those accounts rather than merging all incoming email into a single account. We have support for retrieving mail for a single email account only. Users can login to CM POP3 server using the format "cm/emailaddress" along with the email address password to get the mail for that email address only.

Incoming message limits  - Added ability to limit time spent downloading emails from each account. Useful for slow internet users with tons of messages.

Lock UI  - The user interface can now be locked so that it can't be seen without entering a password.

Approved mail  - You can now preview approved mail through the ChoiceMail GUI

Permission rules  - Added not operator and a (me) special keyword referring to your sources and aliases.

Permission rules  - You can now reference individual Received headers with an index. This lets you easily check the server from which an email really came. Permission rules now support regular expressions - although not intended for users to edit directly (they can), it will allow more sophisticated rules to be downloaded and installed to block known spam. Transform rules are also implemented to preprocess messages to make it easier to detect spam.

Challenges  - You can now optionally use an alternate (optionally fake) FROM address for challenges. This can be used to (a) prevent your real email address from being validated as live by spammers (b) eliminate bounce-back messages completely and (c) prevent a potential spam trick where a spammer could recognize that a challenge was coming and simply respond with a NEW spam using a NEW fake FROM address, thereby attempting to fill up your POP3 inbox.

IMAP  - ChoiceMail now has experimental support for IMAP - no wizards are available though.

Updates

Installer  - We now delete all old ChoiceMail shortcuts that were on the desktop. We also add desktop shortcuts for userguide and keyinfo

Safe Previewer  - We now include the ability to see the raw message.

Setup wizard  - Aliases and mailing lists can now be configured directly from the setup wizard

Authentication  - Updated to support usage of POP3 account credentials with SMTP server. Solves problem with Verizon SMTP servers where one must authenticate with the same username/password as the sending email address.

Permissions  - Added special keywords that can be used to detect whether the email address in the body of your message is (or is not) in your whitelist (see documentation for more information on how to use this feature)

Permission rule testing  - Testing starts after a delay of 1 second of no typing rather than testing every time you type a character.

Permission rules  - A new name is used each time you create a new rule

Permission rules  - New permission rules can be merged into existing permission rules. DigiPortal Software may make new permission rules available from time to time for this purpose.

Enhanced security  - The registration process has been tightened up to remove some theoretically possible breaches.

Fixes


Shutdown  - Fixed problem where ChoiceMail One sometimes prevented MS Windows from shutting down.

Permission rule testing  - The test for self-referenced FROM addresses is now done even if your own domain is in the accept list.

Registration alert popup  - Fixed a problem where the alert popup window was disappearing immediately on some systems.

Username change  - Fixed a problem where changing the username in ChoiceMail One caused lots of grief!

Empty messages  - Corrected a problem where ChoiceMail One could get stuck if the file has a length of 0.

Junkbox  - Added filterReason for mail system messages being deleted.  Without this line, there is no deleted reason when looking at messages in the Junk Box.

Reject with reason  - Fixed a bug where it sometimes wasn't possible to use spaces in the reason.

Domains  - Provide better message if user tries to add a domain that is already on the list.

Hints  - Changed hint for Show Recent Unknown Senders and made the caption reflect when the option was turned on or off.

Norton AV  - Fixed potential problem with older Norton AV usernames that might contain slashes in usernames.

General AV  support - Added handling for special AV case where user might be getting I/O errors instead of our "nice" AV message.

Installer  - Installer now refuses to run if an email application is open. This fixes a problem where the Outlook plugin for ChoiceMail/Exchange was not being installed if Outlook was already running.

Dialogs  - Where possible, increased spacing between controls so that there's less likelihood of characters being cutoff if you are using large fonts.

Setup wizard  - Eudora users can now specify the needed files directly rather than having to do a complete disk search. (Note: this was implemented in 1.505 but somehow it disappeared in subsequent releases!)

Empty FROM  - Fixed a problem where emails were being deleted automatically when it seemed like there was nothing in the FROM header (even though there was).

Empty FROM  - Fixed a bug where an empty FROM header was causing a crash when assertions were enabled

Startup performance  - Initial startup is now faster.

Rejection of system messages  - Was missing filter reason for unverified system messages.

Tab order  - The items in the general preferences now get selected sequentially as you press the TAB key.

List index out of bounds  - Fixed a problem where this error message could appear if you reject a sender with explanation.

Anti-virus collisions  - Added handling for stream errors in case anti-virus removes the temporary files while we are trying to  process them

Junk box  - Fixed a bug where junk box didn't know that messages had been deleted until you quit and restart ChoiceMail.

Integer overflow  - Fixed a problem where ChoiceMail would not allow mail to be retrieved by client if the total size of the mail was greater than 2Gb

Installer  - Installer will now only install into the DigiPortal Software Applications group.

Setup wizard  - Checks that email application is not running more often rather than just once.

Setup wizard  - Changed DELETE button to EXCLUDE in the POP3 source account selection dialog

Hints  - Some buttons in the SMTP settings dialog had incorrect hints.

Email accounts  - Changed "Source enabled" to "Account enabled" label

Permission rules  - Fixed a problem where we were not checking multiple repeated headers (typically , the RECEIVED header) in a message.

Permission rules  - Fixed a problem where multiple messages belong to a single sender were getting deleted incorrectly.

Outlook 2002  - Another attempt to address issues with multiple SRS files

Configuration  - Warn people if they try to change the "logging into ChoiceMail" userid as it's a BAD idea to do this.

Configuration  - Account testing now being done on server side on multi user version

Away/registration messages  - Fixed problem with Getting Default Messages in SingleUser mode that was preventing users from resetting to the default message

Client/Server  - Optimized some communication transfer

Client/Server  - Transferred listing of messages and deleting of messages to server side.  Accounts need to be contacted from the server end and not directly by the client.

Installer  - Fixed a problem where %APPTITLE% was being displayed rather than the program name when uninstalling ChoiceMail One.

Installer  - Fixed a (harmless but annoying) problem where a double-slash was being used in pathnames.

SMTP errors  - Added functionality that allows us to detect unusual SMTP sender errors and force CM to delete a message from sending queue.

Fixes

ChoiceMail 1.503
Release Notes
Fixes
Anti-virus interaction ¡ª Fixed problem where an AV program could delete a newly downloaded but infected email file before ChoiceMail recognized that the download was complete. This would result in ChoiceMail repeatedly trying to download the message over and over again, never deleting the message from POP server.
Disappearing lists ¡ª A recent change appears to have had an odd side-effect of making the sender lists be not displayed on startup. Although we¡¯re still not totally sure why this happened, we have made a change that appears to handle this issue.

Restricting to ¡°today¡± ¡ª When restricting the new senders list to just today¡¯s entries, you can now control how long ¡°today¡± should be, rather than just the calendar day. This fixes a problem where unknown senders appeared to disappear at midnight if the ¡°today¡± filter was enabled.
