"Dec 08, 2014",7.0.1,2,"Loading screen of death iPad Air","Ever since the last update I can't watch anything for more then a few mins. The loading screen comes up and it stays there for 20 mins or more at a time. I've tried deleting and re-downloading. It's not my internet connection. Internet works just fine. I'm about ready to delete it for good and possibly cancel my subscription to Netflix. I don't use any other device so what's the difference between not having it and having it but not able to watch it? If this issue was fixed I would change my review to a better one since I experienced no issues until this point.",,,,Nealsmomma09,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=170528873,1109694378,"United States"

"Dec 07, 2014",7.0.1,2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed in this app. I keep having to shut down my iPad Air when this glitches in order to reset it. I have had to do this daily, since I really enjoy watching shows on Netflix. I can't believe after all of the negative reviews that Netflix hasn't fixed this. When it works it is great. The shows not loading is really annoying, because there is no way out of the screen.",,,,dnawarren,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=425373047,1109595344,"United States"
