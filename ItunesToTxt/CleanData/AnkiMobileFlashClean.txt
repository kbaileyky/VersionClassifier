Release Date: 2014-10-29T13:01:28Z
Update: A bug has been discovered in this version that can cause crashes when syncing if you're upgrading from a previous version and have a lot of media. If you are experiencing this issue, please disable media syncing in the preferences to avoid the crash. We'll have a fix out for this as soon as possible.

- Media syncing changes: files imported via iTunes after the first sync don't need to be resent if they already exist on AnkiWeb, and some connection timeout issues have been resolved. Your local media needs to be checked on your first sync after upgrading, so please be patient if you have a lot of media.

- The custom study and tag selection screens now support rotation, and correctly update when rotated.
- Fix the tag selector window not appearing on iPads on iOS8.

* The navigation bar hiding has been reworked: instead of a thin line at the top of the screen which people found difficult to tap, the navigation bar is now shown or hidden by an action that can be assigned to a tap or swipe in the preferences screen. If you wish to leave it permanently off, you can toggle it off with the action, and then assign the tap or swipe to something else. 
* In the interests of a timely release, hiding the navigation bar will now hide the status bar as well, which works around a layout issue. If possible, the status bar will be made independent again in a future release. 
* Fix an issue with burying cards in a filtered deck. 
* Fix a crash when a sync found inconsistencies.

Version Number: 1.6
Release Date: 2011-01-12T10:03:42Z
If you are on iOS3.2+, it's recommended you create a backup of your decks via iTunes before upgrading.

1.6 brings full compatibility with the new version of Anki for computers. A lot has changed behind the scenes including scheduling cards per-day by default, and easier media handling, so please read the changelog of the desktop program before upgrading AnkiMobile so there are no surprises.

1.6 will upgrade your decks, but it can take a long time on older devices and won't be able to deal with the changes to media syncing or LaTeX, so you may find it easier to upgrade your decks with the desktop client and then copy them over to AnkiMobile. If you are using LaTeX on your cards, please don't upgrade while away from your computer, as the LaTeX cache needs to be rebuilt using the desktop program.
