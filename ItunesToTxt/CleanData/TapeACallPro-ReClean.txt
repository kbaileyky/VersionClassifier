Thank you to everyone who rated the app and left a review. We read all your suggestions and we're pleased to present some awesome new features! 

1. We want to offer a tip to speed up the recording process for users on Verizon and Sprint.  Our tutorial video tells you to place a call to someone, then open TapeACall and press record.  Its actually must faster to open TapeACall and begin recording, then place a call to someone and merge the calls.  Basically do it the other way around and you will skip the 30 second delay.

2. Google Drive support! You can now upload your recordings to Google Drive in 1 click.

3. Evernote support! You can now upload your recordings to Evernote in 1 click.

4. Made some changes to how the app dials the access number for users in certain countries.  The app will attempt to dial the number as it should be dialed from a mobile phone.

Thank you to everyone who rated the app and left a review.  We read all your suggestions and we're pleased to present some awesome new features!

1. Dropbox support! You can now upload your recordings to Dropbox in 1 click.  We made it as simple as possible.

2. You now have the option to attach the recording to an email, or just mail a link to the recording.

3. When you share a recording via email, the app will show you how many megabytes the recording is.  If the recording is over 10 megabytes, or you have a poor internet connection, we recommend you just send a link and download the recording from our website.

4. You can now edit how the app dials the access number.  If you need to remove the country code, or add a carrier code, just go to the settings screen and tap "Access Number"

5. Translated the app into 11 new languages*.  You can manually change the language by opening your iPhone settings app, scrolling down to TapeACall, then selecting "Language"

* Arabic, Bulgarian, Estonian, Finnish, German, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian (bokm_l), Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian

_ Based on your App Store reviews, we have changed what you hear when you dial the access number.  Instead of hearing "Recording... BEEEEEEP..." you'll just hear a very short beep.
_ Based on your App Store reviews, you can now listen to your recordings in the background.  This means you can still hear them when your screen is locked, or while you use other apps.
_ Based on your App Store reviews, If we have multiple access numbers in your country, the app will prompt you to select one.  Our apologies to our Canadian users who might have had a non-local access number selected by default.
_ Fixed a bug where the app wouldn't display any text if the app wasn't translated in your language
_ Fixed an issue where sometimes you have to press the record button multiple times for the app to dial the access number.
_ Thank you to everyone who submitted crash reports.  We fixed numerous crashes.
_ Translated the app into Danish
