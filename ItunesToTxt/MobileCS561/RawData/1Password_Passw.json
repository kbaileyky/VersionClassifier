Can you believe we found them in the couch cushions? It\u2019s always the last place you look, right?\n\n- We discovered a case where sync was being silently disabled while still appearing to be enabled. We\u2019ve fixed that problem now, but if you check your sync settings and find that 1Password last synced days ago you may have been bitten by this bug. Please disable syncing and re-enable it if that\u2019s the case. We\u2019re terribly sorry for the trouble here.\n- Saving a new secure note no longer results in being stuck at that secure note.\n- We believe we have fixed a problem where 1Password would prompt you for your Master Password after entering your PIN code or using Touch ID. We weren't able to reproduce this one in house, but we're pretty sure we got it.\n- We fixed our number one top crasher from version 5.1.1.\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review. We value your workflow too much to interrupt it. If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a review. It means the world to us. Literally\u2026 the world. Thank you in advance!\n\nWe love hearing from you! Come participate on our forums at discussions.agilebits.com, get in touch via @1Password on Twitter, and Facebook.com/1Password!",

If so, this release includes the Touch ID lock screen you saw on screen as well as a number of other fixes and improvements.\n\n- The lock on the lock screen now moves out of the way of the Touch ID prompt so you can enjoy our beautiful design work _and_ Touch ID at the same time, just like Craig did on stage.\n- Speaking of our lock screen, it was starting to feel a tad sluggish, so we gave it a few shots of espresso and it pepped right up.\n- We noticed that the keyboard was making it impossible to see everything when editing an item so we fixed that.\n- We also fixed up a problem where folder contents weren\u2019t being synced properly via iCloud.\n- Did you notice how 1Password had a tendency to dismiss what you were working on when you left the app? That annoyed the tar out of us so we made sure to exorcise that demon with this release.\n- Many more fixes for the most popular issues and crashes.\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review.

We value your workflow too much to interrupt it. If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a review. It makes a huge difference to us. Thank you in advance!\n\n- The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are out. Were you one of the lucky millions who got one already? 1Password 5.1 has been updated to give you a beautiful experience on these new devices with 3x images and improved rich icons.\n\n- Touch ID and the PIN Code have been significantly improved. The Auto-Lock timeout will now function across both the Master Password and Touch ID/PIN Code, removing the confusion the separate settings caused. The iOS Keychain will be used to store the Master Password when Touch ID/PIN Code is enabled, allowing Touch ID/PIN Code to be used reliably in the 1Password Extension. Configure what works best for you in Settings->Security.\n\n- Tag you're it. You can now add brand new tags to your items.\n\n- Custom keyboard preference. Choose to enable or disable 3rd party custom keyboards within the Advanced Settings.\n\n- Many fixes for the most popular issues and crashes\n\nWe love hearing from you!
