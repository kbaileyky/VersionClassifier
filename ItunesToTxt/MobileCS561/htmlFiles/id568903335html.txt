Can you believe we found them in the couch cushions? It\u2019s always the last place you look, right?\n\n- We discovered a case where sync was being silently disabled while still appearing to be enabled. We\u2019ve fixed that problem now, but if you check your sync settings and find that 1Password last synced days ago you may have been bitten by this bug. Please disable syncing and re-enable it if that\u2019s the case. We\u2019re terribly sorry for the trouble here.\n- Saving a new secure note no longer results in being stuck at that secure note.\n- We believe we have fixed a problem where 1Password would prompt you for your Master Password after entering your PIN code or using Touch ID. We weren't able to reproduce this one in house, but we're pretty sure we got it.\n- We fixed our number one top crasher from version 5.1.1.\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review. We value your workflow too much to interrupt it. If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a review. It means the world to us. Literally\u2026 the world.

If so, this release includes the Touch ID lock screen you saw on screen as well as a number of other fixes and improvements.\n\n- The lock on the lock screen now moves out of the way of the Touch ID prompt so you can enjoy our beautiful design work _and_ Touch ID at the same time, just like Craig did on stage.\n- Speaking of our lock screen, it was starting to feel a tad sluggish, so we gave it a few shots of espresso and it pepped right up.\n- We noticed that the keyboard was making it impossible to see everything when editing an item so we fixed that.\n- We also fixed up a problem where folder contents weren\u2019t being synced properly via iCloud.\n- Did you notice how 1Password had a tendency to dismiss what you were working on when you left the app? That annoyed the tar out of us so we made sure to exorcise that demon with this release.\n- Many more fixes for the most popular issues and crashes.\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review.

Were you one of the lucky millions who got one already? 1Password 5.1 has been updated to give you a beautiful experience on these new devices with 3x images and improved rich icons.\n\n- Touch ID and the PIN Code have been significantly improved. The Auto-Lock timeout will now function across both the Master Password and Touch ID/PIN Code, removing the confusion the separate settings caused. The iOS Keychain will be used to store the Master Password when Touch ID/PIN Code is enabled, allowing Touch ID/PIN Code to be used reliably in the 1Password Extension. Configure what works best for you in Settings->Security.\n\n- Tag you're it. You can now add brand new tags to your items.\n\n- Custom keyboard preference. Choose to enable or disable 3rd party custom keyboards within the Advanced Settings.\n\n- Many fixes for the most popular issues and crashes\n\nWe love hearing from you!

There are things that go bump in the night, like password reuse and the internet\u2019s Heartbleed bug. The vastly redesigned 1Password for iOS is the thing that bumps back.\n\n1Password - The Reimagined Edition\n\n◆ This ain\u2019t just a new paint job and an air freshener. We rebuilt 1Password for speed and productivity, adding some of our best and most-requested features - all as a free update to existing version 4 owners\n◆ Note: iOS apps don\u2019t actually support air fresheners (yet?)\n◆ By very, very popular demand, Search is now always accessible at the top of the Categories tab and each main category\n◆ AirDrop - Share items more conveniently, face-to-face\n◆ Our sharing menu is now a good iOS 7 citizen\n◆ iPhone item details for viewing and editing items are now 75-90% more viewtiful and edible. Wait, editable. Yeah\n◆ Nothing says \u201creimagined\u201d like a brand new app icon\n\nMultiple Vaults & Sharing\n\n◆ If you create multiple vaults with 1Password 4 for Mac or Windows, you can now add them to 1Password for iOS and switch between them in Settings. Great for securely sharing items with team members or family, or simply for your own organization!\n◆ Demo Mode is dead, long live the new Demo Vault - We moved our popular Demo Mode feature to Settings > Vaults. You can add the demo vault to demonstrate 1Password without revealing your personal information\n◆ Multiple Dropbox accounts - Have more than one Dropbox account? Great! You can now sync vaults that are shared from different accounts\n\n1Browser is better than ever\n\nOur built-in browser is faster and more powerful, making it easier to login, checkout, and fill forms with a single tap.\n\n◆ One AutoFill to rule them all - Logins, Identities, and Credit Cards are all in the same list in 1Browser, similar to 1Password mini on the Mac!\n◆ 1Browser now prompts you to open non-http and non-https URLs, such as FaceTime call links\n◆ Swipe it to the left, swipe it to the right. *Ahem*, to go back and forward in 1Browser, that is\n◆ The 1Browser tab view got a facelift\n◆ Awesome Circular Progress Indicator in 1Browser - For your page loading pleasure\n\nKeep It Together\n\n◆ Now supporting custom item icons added via 1Password 4 for Mac\n◆ Improvements and bug fixes in Wi-Fi sync\n◆ We made your data file much smaller, which makes sync much faster\n\nGet Organized\n\n◆ The Folders tab on iPhone is now called 'Organize\u2019 because...\n◆ Tags join the party - Tags you add in 1Password for Mac and Windows now appear next to your folders on iOS! Tag on\n\nLocalization\n\n◆ Si vostè està llegint aquest missatge, significa 1Password ha estat traduïda al català! (localization for our Catalan customers!)\n◆ Speaking of which, you can now change 1Password\u2019s language settings within the app\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n◆ New-user setup process is new - It's even easier to get started with 1Password\n◆ Upgrading from 1Password 3 for iOS? The import process is much improved!\n◆ 1Password is now 34% smaller - if you\u2019ve been short 8.6MB of space on your device, we got you covered!\n◆ Persistent PIN code - 1Password now allows you to use your PIN code across launches of the app\n◆ The list of apps supporting 1Password now include newsreaders, finance managers, and even a beer diary! Check out blog.agilebits.com/1password-apps/ to see them all\n◆ Many bugs died to bring us this update\n\nWe love hearing from you!
