The full story behind HQ Audio: 

Audyssey_s HQ Audio optimizes your music at every volume for deep, detailed, pitch-perfect sound. Pick your headphones, play your favorite Songza playlist, and hear the difference.

Audyssey developed a brand new technology to measure headphones and bring them closer to studio reference sound. Using this technology Audyssey creates a unique fine-tuned profile for each of the top-selling headphone brands and makes it available in the world_s largest headphone database.

The Audyssey HQ Audio feature on Songza works by applying this headphone-specific profile to the song file in real-time. Adjustments are made to the music at each frequency so that the signal that the media player sends to the headphone has taken into account its particular fit and specs. The result is studio reference sound that has the quality of a much bigger music file. 

You can turn Audyssey_s HQ Audio on from the Now Playing screen when you have headphones plugged in to your device. Simply slide the HQ switch down, select your headphones and you're done! The HQ switch will turn blue when active.

- Fixed playback crashes on earlier versions of iOS

The full story behind HQ Audio: 
Music is mixed in acoustically calibrated studios by professionals listening at very high volumes. When you listen over headphones two things change: (1) every headphone has its own acoustical characteristics that are different from the studio and (2) most people listen to music at volumes well below studio levels, so their perception of high and low frequency balance is completely different from the original recording. 

Audyssey's audio engineers developed new technology to measure headphone characteristics and bring them closer to studio sound while adjusting the music balance so that it preserves the original content even when listening at lower volumes. 

The HQ Audio feature on Songza works by applying a headphone-specific filter to the song file in real-time that makes adjustments to the music at each frequency so that the signal that the media player sends to the headphone has taken into account its particular fit and specs. The result is sound that has the quality of a much bigger music file and can be heard the way the artist intended it to be heard. 

You can turn HQ Audio on from the Now Playing screen when you have headphones plugged in to your device. Simply slide the HQ switch down, select your headphones and you're done! The HQ switch will turn blue when active.
